This may not sound intuitive as I've made the same mistake in thinking the opposite way before. But later I realized that my feeling of busy or rushing all the time is merely an obscure excuse used by myself. Imagine breaking an eight-hour workday into two equal parts, namely coding and meeting with four hours for each. Also taking into account our poor perception of time by safely allocating an additional hour for each part to be completed in reality. There're two different ways of spending of our time. <img alt=\"Coding first, meeting second\" srcSet=\"/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fs3. us-west-2. amazonaws. com%2Fsecure. notion-static. com%2F20d31533-e391-42ae-9514-ac319faddc73%2FUntitled. png%3FX-Amz-Algorithm%3DAWS4-HMAC-SHA256%26X-Amz-Content-Sha256%3DUNSIGNED-PAYLOAD%26X-Amz-Credential%3DAKIAT73L2G45EIPT3X45%252F20230324%252Fus-west-2%252Fs3%252Faws4_request%26X-Amz-Date%3D20230324T043737Z%26X-Amz-Expires%3D86400%26X-Amz-Signature%3D03c693bfc158e866438b37e576fe75c62d5325f65abc10c279b7a785c8f32cf2%26X-Amz-SignedHeaders%3Dhost%26x-id%3DGetObject&amp;w=640&amp;q=75 1x, /_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fs3. us-west-2. amazonaws. com%2Fsecure. notion-static. com%2F20d31533-e391-42ae-9514-ac319faddc73%2FUntitled. png%3FX-Amz-Algorithm%3DAWS4-HMAC-SHA256%26X-Amz-Content-Sha256%3DUNSIGNED-PAYLOAD%26X-Amz-Credential%3DAKIAT73L2G45EIPT3X45%252F20230324%252Fus-west-2%252Fs3%252Faws4_request%26X-Amz-Date%3D20230324T043737Z%26X-Amz-Expires%3D86400%26X-Amz-Signature%3D03c693bfc158e866438b37e576fe75c62d5325f65abc10c279b7a785c8f32cf2%26X-Amz-SignedHeaders%3Dhost%26x-id%3DGetObject&amp;w=828&amp;q=75 2x\" src=\"/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fs3. us-west-2. amazonaws. com%2Fsecure. notion-static. com%2F20d31533-e391-42ae-9514-ac319faddc73%2FUntitled. png%3FX-Amz-Algorithm%3DAWS4-HMAC-SHA256%26X-Amz-Content-Sha256%3DUNSIGNED-PAYLOAD%26X-Amz-Credential%3DAKIAT73L2G45EIPT3X45%252F20230324%252Fus-west-2%252Fs3%252Faws4_request%26X-Amz-Date%3D20230324T043737Z%26X-Amz-Expires%3D86400%26X-Amz-Signature%3D03c693bfc158e866438b37e576fe75c62d5325f65abc10c279b7a785c8f32cf2%26X-Amz-SignedHeaders%3Dhost%26x-id%3DGetObject&amp;w=828&amp;q=75\" decoding=\"async\" data-nimg=\"intrinsic\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%;object-fit:cover\" loading=\"lazy\"/>Coding first, meeting second<img alt=\"Meeting first, coding second\" srcSet=\"/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fs3. us-west-2. amazonaws. com%2Fsecure. notion-static. com%2Fc6696d07-743c-4f5f-9aa7-11f101cc4e87%2FUntitled. png%3FX-Amz-Algorithm%3DAWS4-HMAC-SHA256%26X-Amz-Content-Sha256%3DUNSIGNED-PAYLOAD%26X-Amz-Credential%3DAKIAT73L2G45EIPT3X45%252F20230324%252Fus-west-2%252Fs3%252Faws4_request%26X-Amz-Date%3D20230324T043737Z%26X-Amz-Expires%3D86400%26X-Amz-Signature%3D6f22b9d04c9e8435f5628f064e5d4a4dcb86b7fd0a1d0a702369bd53efe9c01b%26X-Amz-SignedHeaders%3Dhost%26x-id%3DGetObject&amp;w=640&amp;q=75 1x, /_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fs3. us-west-2. amazonaws. com%2Fsecure. notion-static. com%2Fc6696d07-743c-4f5f-9aa7-11f101cc4e87%2FUntitled. png%3FX-Amz-Algorithm%3DAWS4-HMAC-SHA256%26X-Amz-Content-Sha256%3DUNSIGNED-PAYLOAD%26X-Amz-Credential%3DAKIAT73L2G45EIPT3X45%252F20230324%252Fus-west-2%252Fs3%252Faws4_request%26X-Amz-Date%3D20230324T043737Z%26X-Amz-Expires%3D86400%26X-Amz-Signature%3D6f22b9d04c9e8435f5628f064e5d4a4dcb86b7fd0a1d0a702369bd53efe9c01b%26X-Amz-SignedHeaders%3Dhost%26x-id%3DGetObject&amp;w=828&amp;q=75 2x\" src=\"/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fs3. us-west-2. amazonaws. com%2Fsecure. notion-static. com%2Fc6696d07-743c-4f5f-9aa7-11f101cc4e87%2FUntitled. png%3FX-Amz-Algorithm%3DAWS4-HMAC-SHA256%26X-Amz-Content-Sha256%3DUNSIGNED-PAYLOAD%26X-Amz-Credential%3DAKIAT73L2G45EIPT3X45%252F20230324%252Fus-west-2%252Fs3%252Faws4_request%26X-Amz-Date%3D20230324T043737Z%26X-Amz-Expires%3D86400%26X-Amz-Signature%3D6f22b9d04c9e8435f5628f064e5d4a4dcb86b7fd0a1d0a702369bd53efe9c01b%26X-Amz-SignedHeaders%3Dhost%26x-id%3DGetObject&amp;w=828&amp;q=75\" decoding=\"async\" data-nimg=\"intrinsic\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%;object-fit:cover\" loading=\"lazy\"/>Meeting first, coding second One way we can do is meeting first, coding second. We'll finish the meeting part of the day, owing an hour of debt for the coding part. I'll be really upset in this case. Many reason can account for this, maybe there's a deadline for the coding task, or the meetings make me feel counterproductive, or I solely want to get some real shit done. Whatever the reason is, I'll leave the workday feeling really busy. The other way is coding first, meeting second. We'll finish the coding part of the day, owing an hour of debt for the meeting part. I won't be upset about it at all. I'll be relaxed for the rest of day and happily discard any meetings if they’re discardable given I’m joining a lot of them solely for presence anyway. Regardless of what, I'll leave the workday without feeling busy. Obviously, it's only an analogy that oversimplifies what a workday may look like. But the idea can be easily extended to a full day of our life. If we can have truly important things done for the day, would we still feel busy? Or in other words, are we busy because of lack of time or lack of self accountability to set priorities❓ \"Keep calm and make epic shit.\"","length":6946,"tokens":3069,"chunks":[{"essay_title":"<img

I'll be really upset in this case. Many reason can account for this, maybe there's a deadline for the coding task, or the meetings make me feel counterproductive, or I solely want to get some real shit done. Whatever the reason is, I'll leave the workday feeling really busy. The other way is coding first, meeting second. We'll finish the coding part of the day, owing an hour of debt for the meeting part. I won't be upset about it at all. I'll be relaxed for the rest of day and happily discard any meetings if they’re discardable given I’m joining a lot of them solely for presence anyway. Regardless of what, I'll leave the workday without feeling busy. Obviously, it's only an analogy that oversimplifies what a workday may look like. But the idea can be easily extended to a full day of our life. If we can have truly important things done for the day, would we still feel busy? Or in other words, are we busy because of lack of time or lack of self accountability to set priorities❓ \"Keep calm and make epic shit.\"","content_length":1106,"content_tokens":253,"embedding":[]}]},{"title":"<img alt=\"Fix rss feed\" srcSet=\"/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.notion.so%2Fimage%2Fhttps%253A%252F%252Fcdn.pixabay.com%252Fphoto%252F2012%252F04%252F15%252F22%252F00%252Frss-35468_1280.png%3Ftable%3Dblock%26id%3D442a546f-e590-415d-a5c2-fdf76aca5e57%26cache%3Dv2&amp;w=2048&amp;q=75 1x, /_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.notion.so%2Fimage%2Fhttps%253A%252F%252Fcdn.pixabay.com%252Fphoto%252F2012%252F04%252F15%252F22%252F00%252Frss-35468_1280.png%3Ftable%3Dblock%26id%3D442a546f-e590-415d-a5c2-fdf76aca5e57%26cache%3Dv2&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x\" src=\"/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.notion.so%2Fimage%2Fhttps%253A%252F%252Fcdn.pixabay.com%252Fphoto%252F2012%252F04%252F15%252F22%252F00%252Frss-35468_1280.png%3Ftable%3Dblock%26id%3D442a546f-e590-415d-a5c2-fdf76aca5e57%26cache%3Dv2&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75\" decoding=\"async\" data-nimg=\"intrinsic\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%\" class=\"notion-page-title-icon notion-page-icon\" loading=\"lazy\"/>Fix rss feed","url":"https://blog.liallen.me/fix-rss-feed","date":"August 26, 2022","thanks":"","content":"<img alt=\"Fix rss feed\" srcSet=\"/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww. notion. so%2Fimage%2Fhttps%253A%252F%252Fcdn. pixabay. com%252Fphoto%252F2012%252F04%252F15%252F22%252F00%252Frss-35468_1280. png%3Ftable%3Dblock%26id%3D442a546f-e590-415d-a5c2-fdf76aca5e57%26cache%3Dv2&amp;w=2048&amp;q=75 1x, /_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww. notion. so%2Fimage%2Fhttps%253A%252F%252Fcdn. pixabay. com%252Fphoto%252F2012%252F04%252F15%252F22%252F00%252Frss-35468_1280. png%3Ftable%3Dblock%26id%3D442a546f-e590-415d-a5c2-fdf76aca5e57%26cache%3Dv2&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x\" src=\"/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww. notion. so%2Fimage%2Fhttps%253A%252F%252Fcdn. pixabay. com%252Fphoto%252F2012%252F04%252F15%252F22%252F00%252Frss-35468_1280. png%3Ftable%3Dblock%26id%3D442a546f-e590-415d-a5c2-fdf76aca5e57%26cache%3Dv2&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75\" decoding=\"async\" data-nimg=\"intrinsic\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%\" class=\"notion-page-icon\" loading=\"lazy\"/>Fix rss feedTagsNext. jsNotionDescriptionPublishedPublished I’ve noticed that there is some issue with this blog’s RSS feed, but I haven’t got a chance to look into it.

In order to figure out why the feed isn’t rendering properly, I choose to validate it against the RSS Specific first using RSS validator to see if there’s any syntax issue. The validation turns out to be fine, so I assume there might be some optional elements (see 👇) missing in my case. I checked the generated feed and noticed that both content and enclosure are missing. RSS SpecificationChannel elementstitle (required)description (required)url (required)ttl (optional)pubDate (optional)etcItem elements (all optional besides title/description)titledescription enclosurecontent (custom element)pubDateetcHow to fixTo add the missing elements to the feed, I need to figure out how’s the RSS feed gets generated first. <img alt=\"Tech stack of this blog\" srcSet=\"/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fs3. us-west-2. amazonaws. com%2Fsecure. notion-static. com%2Fe4336706-cf7e-47b1-bbd3-77affaca0e4a%2FUntitled. png%3FX-Amz-Algorithm%3DAWS4-HMAC-SHA256%26X-Amz-Content-Sha256%3DUNSIGNED-PAYLOAD%26X-Amz-Credential%3DAKIAT73L2G45EIPT3X45%252F20230324%252Fus-west-2%252Fs3%252Faws4_request%26X-Amz-Date%3D20230324T043738Z%26X-Amz-Expires%3D86400%26X-Amz-Signature%3D56da58a2e698911716945e4ae59ee3e7f00b906334404c4aa856daac15474e86%26X-Amz-SignedHeaders%3Dhost%26x-id%3DGetObject&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 1x, /_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fs3. us-west-2. amazonaws. com%2Fsecure. notion-static. com%2Fe4336706-cf7e-47b1-bbd3-77affaca0e4a%2FUntitled. png%3FX-Amz-Algorithm%3DAWS4-HMAC-SHA256%26X-Amz-Content-Sha256%3DUNSIGNED-PAYLOAD%26X-Amz-Credential%3DAKIAT73L2G45EIPT3X45%252F20230324%252Fus-west-2%252Fs3%252Faws4_request%26X-Amz-Date%3D20230324T043738Z%26X-Amz-Expires%3D86400%26X-Amz-Signature%3D56da58a2e698911716945e4ae59ee3e7f00b906334404c4aa856daac15474e86%26X-Amz-SignedHeaders%3Dhost%26x-id%3DGetObject&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x\" src=\"/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fs3. us-west-2. amazonaws. com%2Fsecure. notion-static. com%2Fe4336706-cf7e-47b1-bbd3-77affaca0e4a%2FUntitled. png%3FX-Amz-Algorithm%3DAWS4-HMAC-SHA256%26X-Amz-Content-Sha256%3DUNSIGNED-PAYLOAD%26X-Amz-Credential%3DAKIAT73L2G45EIPT3X45%252F20230324%252Fus-west-2%252Fs3%252Faws4_request%26X-Amz-Date%3D20230324T043738Z%26X-Amz-Expires%3D86400%26X-Amz-Signature%3D56da58a2e698911716945e4ae59ee3e7f00b906334404c4aa856daac15474e86%26X-Amz-SignedHeaders%3Dhost%26x-id%3DGetObject&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75\" decoding=\"async\" data-nimg=\"intrinsic\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%;object-fit:cover\" loading=\"lazy\"/>Tech stack of this blogThis blog is actually a static website powered by Next. js with Notion as data source. Image 👆 gives a glimpse about its tech stack. Data source are blog posts that made available either through Headless CMS or Local File System. Since I’m using Notion as a headless CMS, the latest feed of this site can only be derived from accessing the Notion APIs. Headless CMSData (Posts) made available at run time (e. g. pulling from APIs). Publishing new posts will not require new deployment of this site and latest feed can only be fetched from remote API. Local File SystemData (Posts) made available at build time (e. g. parsing static markup files). Publishing new posts will trigger new deployment of this site and latest feed gets updated as part of the deployment process. However, since the official Notion client doesn’t offer any methods for rendering each post, I need a custom html renderer doing this. I’ve found one that works.

I end up using some file caching to get around it. const fileCache = path. join(process. cwd(), 'rss. data. json') const cache = JSON. parse(fs. readFileSync(fileCache, 'utf-8')) for (const pagePath of Object. keys(siteMap. canonicalPageMap)) { // ... if (cache[pageId]) { feedItems. push(cache[pageId]) continue } // ... cache[pageId] = feedItem feedItems. push(cache[pageId]) } Once the missing elements are being added, the change won’t be immediately live due to the second problem. it’s not hard to guess that is related to caching. There’re two levels of cache worth noticing, one is the <ttl> sub-element of the above channel element, the other one is the feed endpoint (i. e. /feed of this site) has aCache-Control directive set to public, max-age=86400, stale-while-revalidate=86400. Instead, I reset it to public, max-age=0, must-revalidate to disable caching so that all latest posts will be “seen” by RSS readers.

Notion as data source. Image 👆 gives a glimpse about its tech stack. Data source are blog posts that made available either through Headless CMS or Local File System. Since I’m using Notion as a headless CMS, the latest feed of this site can only be derived from accessing the Notion APIs. Headless CMSData (Posts) made available at run time (e. g. pulling from APIs) Publishing new posts will not require new deployment of this site and latest feed can only be fetched from remote API.

AwakeningProblems cannot be solved with the same mind set that created them.- Albert EinsteinAfter years of struggling with work and life, I decided that I need a change. I don’t know what’s the path forward and I couldn’t even tell why I’m suffering that much. But there’s one thing I’m sure about, that’s the “same shit, different year” style of life can’t be tolerated anymore. Since then, the veil of the mythical struggles slowly unfolds, moments of awakening begin to arise. In fact, I don’t think I understand what awakening means until the word pops into my head too often times to dismiss. The moment of enlightenment brought to me so much relief that all my stupidities became transparent but normal, as well as made me to question why I didn’t strive for it earlier. There’s a book which I stumbled across at the beginning of year made a nonlinear impact on this wake-up process, it unpacks so many questions I’ve accumulated over the years with actionable advice that it eventually leads me to a paradigm shift. Highly recommend to anyone in similar situations. However, a firm belief on the need to change won’t magically solve the what and how of the problem, it merely marks the beginning of a pathless path at best. The cruel reality is that I don’t even know how to set and track goals on my own as I never bothered doing them. I’m simply going with the flow, living a life in autopilot mode, the classic example of you don’t know what you don’t know. Thanks to the source of inspiration of this blog and his article about unlearning, I figure out that to learn again I’d better unlearn what I’ve learned first. TimeWe have two lives, and the second begins when we realize we only have one - Confucius I used to be a layback (a polite way of saying lazy) guy. The idea of managing time and planning ahead feel too overwhelming to me that I couldn’t imagine how I’ll do that. My parents don’t ask me to do it as well, so I had a rather happy childhood. I think it’s a character thing. Like I was always late for school and was a complete disaster on subjects that I’m not interested in. Not to say I’m immune to peer pressure, it just seems that those things aren’t important enough for me to give too much fuck about. Until I came across in recent year, I start to realize that I barely know anything about time. There’re a few other articles reshaped my understanding about it and I've included them in the🔖2022 articles. I’m far from being able to manage it well, but the importance of it really shouldn’t be emphasized, “until we can manage time we can manage nothing else” borrowing it from the management leader Peter Drucker. HabitsA non-negotiable contractI participated in the 🌉SF marathon 10k and I really loved the experience! Not because it’s hard, it’s not a marathon and most people can do (and actually did) it without practice. But there’s a hidden story, I made a contract with myself while listening to the Atomic Habits audiobook to build a new habit only to prove to myself that I can do it. And I ended up choosing running simply because there’s no excuse if it fails. It’s also not conditioned on external factors like seeking social approvals, otherwise I may go do some muscle work. Not to say there’s any issue with that, it’s just motivation conditioned on external factors is hardly sustainable compare to more intrinsic drives. The deal I made with myself is definite and reachable, except negotiable. The biggest implication it has on me is that If I can’t do it, I probably can’t do anything. I think I’ve made it, it might be small on its own, but it’s an important stepping stone for any greater progress to be made. ReadingYou can’t think well without writing well, and you can’t write well without reading well - http://www. paulgraham. com/read. htmlReading shouldn’t be optional, whether it’s for fun or for learning.

I don’t have a writing habit of any form, no diary, no journaling, no whatever. Look at the very first Post, it’s merely a few scattered thoughts on the latest frontend (web) tools. Then there’s the the takeaway I had on my last job, which I want to keep a record as reminder. The rest are just a few small experiments that I run from time to time, as I’m finally convinced that if I don’t hold myself accountable in changing bad habits that don’t work, I’d only end up in the same bad situation again the next year. Probably the biggest benefit for me is that writing helps clear thinking a lot. Not until I type my thoughts into words do I notice my thinking is a mess. It’s too easy to get distracted by small talks in random conversations while ignoring the importance of common sense and logic. Writing makes fallacies in thinking hard to hide. MeditationMeditation is intermittent fasting for the mind. Too much sugar leads to a heavy body, and too many distractions lead to a heavy mind. Time spent undistracted and alone, in self-examination, journaling, meditation, resolves the unresolved and takes us from mentally fat to fit. - NavalIt’s a new habit and I still feel that I know nothing about it after a couple months of practice. But the benefits are clear, I’m feeling less rushed than before as my mind gets calmer. I can’t explain the neurological effects it has done to our brain but I know what a busy mind was like. I’ve heard about people’s frustration about how hard it’s to focus during the practice, I’m having the same issue besides I tend to think that’s probably a good reason we’re doing this in the first place. I’m not attached to the outcome as well, I’m merely curious to explore and understand myself better. I started learning about the topic from an introductory book by Andy, along with his Headspace App (lovely animations) to learn the basics. After a few months of trial, I discovered a good deal on another meditation App by Sam Harris. Have a calmer mind is essential for cultivating better self awareness and meditation has some magic on that. FinanceI’d wish I have something useful to share, but unfortunately I’m completely noob on this. I’m kind of person who puts all his money in his bank saving account. The only thing I didn’t do wrong about finance is that I don’t spend as much, due to the same reason I don’t educate myself about it. Financial literacy is important, I started tracking my spendings last year and I’ll definitely learn more about it and investment this year. But there’s an interesting story about it, as I knew nothing about the tactics I cannot do much besides following some big names. And some YouTube channel (e. g. this one) understands its potential audience, it knows that we’re more sensitive to negative news, especially during a economic downturn period, the channel keeps posting videos with misleading titles. And I got upset by watching that. Luckily I got reminded by a friend about my groundless panic. Be cautious of media that uses keywords like “EVERYTHING”, “LAST”, “COLLAPSE” mixed with celebrity names as its titles. I didn’t subscribe to those channels but the recommendation algorithm keeps pushing its contents to me, 🖕 the algorithm. Social mediaIf you're not paying for the product, then you're the product - https://www. thesocialdilemma. com/The moment I notice that I need conscious effort in deciding if I should hit the damn like button as if it’s yelling at me, I know something goes wrong. I quitted WeChat for a while and it turned out to be too radical, overcompensate to compensate as pointed out by a friend. We all know that social media and smartphone apps are addictive, the iOS screen time stats won’t lie. But it’s probably less obvious about what makes the algorithms powering those apps so addictive. Hooked by Nir Eyal is an eye-opening read on this topic, it well demystifies some of the black magic and dark patterns behind the trillion dollar enterprise business. Another book which focuses more on practical solutions to the problem is Digital Minimalism by Cal Newport. I did a📵One week digital decluttering experiment after reading that, and I think it’s a good mindfulness exercise for our digital habits. It’s neither black or white, but I find it helpful to keep social media at a right distance. RelocationI left SF in November and I took the chance to take the🎒100 thing challenge . I was asked about why, but I don’t have a firm answer to be honest. Anything makes it a good reason to leave, there’s something else to counterbalance. One thing that I’m a bit regret is that that I’m not living up to the type of ambition that Silicon Valley is known for. I do have or had the hoodies, free snacks, or other perks popularized by the Valley in TV or news. But they’re byproducts, not the substance of any great culture. Remote work carries a disproportion weight on this decision. No one knows for sure what the workplace will look like in the future, but the Pandora’s box once opened can’t be reversed. Airbnb has gradually become my defacto way to find a place for stay in new locations, the random acquaintance with different hosts has always been my favorite part of it, though the overall guest experience is getting homogeneous over the years. WorkI’m working to learn and I have no interest in climbing the ladder or any kind of status game. That said, I opt out of the game of career advancement. I don’t think I’ve figured out how to do this well yet. But look at the bright side, it leaves me lots of room for improvement. A few takeaways from work that I turned into blog posts.

As mentioned, this blog was pretty much inspired by Derek Sivers. I can’t explain why but his ideas, thoughts and life philosophy just click for me. Maybe because he sings the counter-melody. There’s a period of time, I listen to the audible version of Hell Yeah or No everyday and I won’t get bored by doing that. I’ve never done anything similar before. Friends come and go, I can’t do much about it. But if I’ve made deliberate effort in relationships that are important to me is another story, it is within my control. There’re definitely times that I felt like shit and don’t know how to get passed that bad mental state. Meditation helps unpack certain cloudy emotions, but it’s no substitute for great friendship. A deep conversation, a warm encouragement or a silent company can all make huge difference in an instant. My relationship with parents also gets better. I used to be so impatient about our conversation that it rarely lasts longer than a couple minutes, and I’ve lost faith in understanding each other. But I start to listen more and seek to understand them better, although it’s not easy and it takes practice to get better at communications, at least I can see a path forward. This beautiful article from Tim Urban really brought me to think harder about relationships. Also the simple fact that I can sit and brain dump all these nonsense in a safe and warm place is an unearned privileged. There’re billions of people suffering from unimaginable chaos and conflicts in the world right now, or maybe always. It still strikes me that the reply I got after asking an office housekeeper lady (from EI Salvador 🇸🇻 ) about her hobby is “What’s a hobby?”. Wrap upIt’s a long post and so was the year. As a life long sports fan, the most exciting moment of the year has to be Leon Messi and his 🇦🇷 team holding the 🏆 of 2022 World Cup above their head.

There’s a book which I stumbled across at the beginning of year made a nonlinear impact on this wake-up process, it unpacks so many questions I’ve accumulated over the years with actionable advice that it eventually leads me to a paradigm shift. Highly recommend to anyone in similar situations. However, a firm belief on the need to change won’t magically solve the what and how of the problem, it merely marks the beginning of a pathless path at best.

However, in a real world, we are more often faced with the question like “I want to practice meditation and I’ve heard that some App with paid subscription may help with that, which App should I choose?” instead. What would you choose then? I can’t speak for others, but I can learn from my past self. When I value the price, I’d choose whatever App that’s free, everything else comes the second. After all, who doesn’t like something that’s free? (free food, free speech, free open software …)When I value the practice, I’d choose whatever App that’s available to me to get started, everything else comes the second. After all, every minute wasted on deciding which app to choose is the time you can spend on doing the practice. When I value the product, I’d choose the App that offers the best service, everything else comes the second. After all, who doesn’t want their needs to be served well? Back to the original question, though it doesn’t appear often in today’s world dominated by all sorts of ads, it’s something that I’m facing at the moment as I want to try the app to learn more about meditation.

But the prerequisite is that you’ve got enough information in a reasonable timeframe, and that itself is usually the tricky part for any kind of decision making unfortunately.<img alt=\"notion image\" srcSet=\"/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fs3. us-west-2. amazonaws. com%2Fsecure. notion-static. com%2F09f09cc6-678f-4588-837a-66be5e236523%2F4A27D9ED-D3C4-4E15-A992-80F1EEA323DC.","content_length":937,"content_tokens":275,"embedding":[]},{"essay_title":"ℹ️Easy choice, hard choice","essay_url":"https://blog.liallen.me/easy-choice-hard-choice","essay_date":"November 30, 2022","essay_thanks":"","content":"jpeg%3FX-Amz-Algorithm%3DAWS4-HMAC-SHA256%26X-Amz-Content-Sha256%3DUNSIGNED-PAYLOAD%26X-Amz-Credential%3DAKIAT73L2G45EIPT3X45%252F20230325%252Fus-west-2%252Fs3%252Faws4_request%26X-Amz-Date%3D20230325T024847Z%26X-Amz-Expires%3D86400%26X-Amz-Signature%3D6d34059ecf7cf02b0013407fb57e8b7fd56bb482c03f4bd5d4a2d4db0c67042c%26X-Amz-SignedHeaders%3Dhost%26x-id%3DGetObject&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 1x, /_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fs3. us-west-2. amazonaws. com%2Fsecure. notion-static. com%2F09f09cc6-678f-4588-837a-66be5e236523%2F4A27D9ED-D3C4-4E15-A992-80F1EEA323DC.","content_length":557,"content_tokens":318,"embedding":[]},{"essay_title":"ℹ️Easy choice, hard choice","essay_url":"https://blog.liallen.me/easy-choice-hard-choice","essay_date":"November 30, 2022","essay_thanks":"","content":"jpeg%3FX-Amz-Algorithm%3DAWS4-HMAC-SHA256%26X-Amz-Content-Sha256%3DUNSIGNED-PAYLOAD%26X-Amz-Credential%3DAKIAT73L2G45EIPT3X45%252F20230325%252Fus-west-2%252Fs3%252Faws4_request%26X-Amz-Date%3D20230325T024847Z%26X-Amz-Expires%3D86400%26X-Amz-Signature%3D6d34059ecf7cf02b0013407fb57e8b7fd56bb482c03f4bd5d4a2d4db0c67042c%26X-Amz-SignedHeaders%3Dhost%26x-id%3DGetObject&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x\" src=\"/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fs3. us-west-2. amazonaws. com%2Fsecure. notion-static. com%2F09f09cc6-678f-4588-837a-66be5e236523%2F4A27D9ED-D3C4-4E15-A992-80F1EEA323DC.","content_length":562,"content_tokens":320,"embedding":[]},{"essay_title":"ℹ️Easy choice, hard choice","essay_url":"https://blog.liallen.me/easy-choice-hard-choice","essay_date":"November 30, 2022","essay_thanks":"","content":"jpeg%3FX-Amz-Algorithm%3DAWS4-HMAC-SHA256%26X-Amz-Content-Sha256%3DUNSIGNED-PAYLOAD%26X-Amz-Credential%3DAKIAT73L2G45EIPT3X45%252F20230325%252Fus-west-2%252Fs3%252Faws4_request%26X-Amz-Date%3D20230325T024847Z%26X-Amz-Expires%3D86400%26X-Amz-Signature%3D6d34059ecf7cf02b0013407fb57e8b7fd56bb482c03f4bd5d4a2d4db0c67042c%26X-Amz-SignedHeaders%3Dhost%26x-id%3DGetObject&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75\" decoding=\"async\" data-nimg=\"intrinsic\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%;object-fit:cover\" loading=\"lazy\"/>","content_length":664,"content_tokens":325,"embedding":[]}]},{"title":"🌀New PHP or the Future","url":"https://blog.liallen.me/new-php-or-the-future","date":"November 19, 2022","thanks":"","content":"🌀New PHP or the FutureTagsWebNext. jsDescriptionPublishedPublished Next. js 13Next. js 13 introduces layouts, React Server Components, and streaming in the app directory, as well as Turbopack, an improved image component, and the brand new font component. https://nextjs. org/blog/next-13<img alt=\"Next. js 13\" srcSet=\"/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww. notion. so%2Fimage%2Fhttps%253A%252F%252Fnextjs. org%252Fstatic%252Fblog%252Fnext-13%252Ftwitter-card. png%3Ftable%3Dblock%26id%3Db6f5d901-6c86-4cc2-9966-8a337eac6537%26cache%3Dv2&amp;w=2048&amp;q=75 1x, /_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww. notion. so%2Fimage%2Fhttps%253A%252F%252Fnextjs. org%252Fstatic%252Fblog%252Fnext-13%252Ftwitter-card. png%3Ftable%3Dblock%26id%3Db6f5d901-6c86-4cc2-9966-8a337eac6537%26cache%3Dv2&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x\" src=\"/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww. notion. so%2Fimage%2Fhttps%253A%252F%252Fnextjs. org%252Fstatic%252Fblog%252Fnext-13%252Ftwitter-card. png%3Ftable%3Dblock%26id%3Db6f5d901-6c86-4cc2-9966-8a337eac6537%26cache%3Dv2&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75\" decoding=\"async\" data-nimg=\"intrinsic\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%;object-fit:cover\" loading=\"lazy\"/> The recent release of Next. js 13, mixed with a lot of hype and promotions, has sparked an interesting discussion about the trend of reviving PHP programming in modern web development.

The book lays out five fundamental habits used to improve our thinking skills, backed by convincing evidences that through continuous practice of those habits, we can all become a better thinker. Understand deeply: Don’t face complex issues head-on; first understand simple ideas deeply. Clear the clutter and expose what is really important. Be brutally honest about what you know and don’t know. Then see what’s missing, identify the gaps, and fill them in. Let go of bias, prejudice, and preconceived notions. There are degrees to understanding (it’s not just a yes-or-no proposition) and you can always heighten yours. Rock-solid understanding is the foundation for success. Make mistakes: Fail to succeed. Intentionally get it wrong to inevitably get it even more right. Mistakes are great teachers—they highlight unforeseen opportunities and holes in your understanding. They also show you which way to turn next, and they ignite your imagination. Raise questions: Constantly create questions to clarify and extend your understanding. What’s the real question? Working on the wrong questions can waste a lifetime. Ideas are in the air—the right questions will bring them out and help you see connections that otherwise would have been invisible. Follow the flow of ideas: Look back to see where ideas came from and then look ahead to discover where those ideas may lead. A new idea is a beginning, not an end. Ideas are rare—milk them. Following the consequences of small ideas can result in big payoffs. Change: The unchanging element is change—by mastering the first four elements, you can change the way you think and learn. You can always improve, grow, and extract more out of your education, yourself, and the way you live your life. Change is the universal constant that allows you to get the most out of living and learning. Introduction I know quite certainly that I myself have no special talent. Curiosity, obsession and dogged endurance, combined with self-criticism, have brought me to my ideas. —Albert Einstein Brilliant students and brilliant innovators create their own victories by practicing habits of thinking that inevitably carry them step-by-step to works of greatness. Education is what survives when what has been learned has been forgotten. —B. F. Skinner Grounding Your Thinking What is deep understanding?In everything you do, refine your skills and knowledge about fundamental concepts and simple cases. Once is never enough. As you revisit fundamentals, you will find new insights. It may appear that returning to basics is a step backward and requires additional time and effort; however, by building on firm foundations you will soon see your true abilities soar higher and faster. The whole of science is merely a refinement of everyday thinking. —Albert EinsteinThe simple and familiar hold the secrets of the complex and unknown. The depth with which you master the basics influences how well you understand everything you learn after that. If you can’t solve a problem, then there is an easier problem you can’t solve: find it. —George PolyaApply this mind-set to your work: when faced with a difficult issue or challenge, do something else. Focus entirely on solving a subproblem that you know you can successfully resolve. Clear the clutter. Uncover the essence. When faced with an issue that is complicated and multifaceted, attempt to isolate the essential ingredients. Step One: Identify and ignore all distracting features to isolate the essential core. Step Two: Analyze that central issue and apply those insights to the larger whole. To better understand your world, consciously acknowledge what you actually see—no matter how mundane or obvious—rather than guess at what you think you are supposed to see. You (and everyone else) have prejudices. Admit it already and move forward from there. Whenever you “see” an issue or “understand” a concept, be conscious of the lens through which you’re viewing the subject. You should assume you’re introducing bias. The challenge remains to identify and let go of that bias or the assumptions you bring, and actively work to see and understand the subject anew. Being honest and accurate about what you actually know and don’t know forces you to identify and fill gaps in your understanding. It is at the interface between what you actually know and what you don’t yet know that true learning and growth occur. How can you see what’s truly invisible?Add the adjective and uncover the gaps. What if we had called it “World War I” back in 1918? Such a label might have made the possibility of a second worldwide conflict a greater reality for governments and individuals, and might have led to better international policy decisions. We become conscious of issues when we explicitly identify and articulate them. Fail to SucceedFailing productively involves two basic steps: creating the mistake and then exploiting the mistake. You may not know how to do it right, but you can certainly do it wrong. A good way to generate useful mistakes is simply to tackle the issue at hand by quickly constructing the best solution you can with little or no effort. Two reactions to mistakes. So when you see or make a mistake, you have at least two actions to take: (1) let the mistake lead you to a better attempt, and/or (2) ask whether the mistake is a correct answer to a different question. Failing by intent Deliberately exaggerating or considering extreme, impractical scenarios often frees us to have an unforeseen insight. For example, manufacturers conduct stress tests to the point of breaking a product. Failure is a sign of a creative mind, of original thought and strength. A person who is willing to fail is someone who is willing to step outside the box. Being willing to fail is a liberating attribute of transformative thinking. A ship in port is safe, but that’s not what ships are built for. —Admiral Grace Murray Hopper Creating Questions out of Thin Air Teach to learn. Constantly formulating and raising questions is a mind-opening habit that forces you to have a deeper engagement with the world and a different inner experience. Ask meta-questions Asking questions should not be reserved for moments when you don’t know an answer. Even when you do know the answer, asking, “What if … ?” is a great way to see more and delve deeper. asking questions about an assignment or project before beginning work in earnest will always lead to a stronger final product. Ask, “What’s the goal of this task?” and “What benefit flows from the task?” Keep that benefit in mind as you move forward. Overcoming bias. Challenge everything and everyone—including your teachers. Don’t be intimidated. You are the best authority on what you don’t understand—trust yourself: don’t be afraid to ask the questions you need to ask, and be brave enough to change your thinking when you uncover a blind spot. Creating questions enlivens your curiosityA questionable habit. Constantly generate questions and then ask them—that mind-set will lead to a richer appreciation of the issues. Be thought provoking. Getting in the habit of asking questions will transform you into an active (rather than passive) listener. Often the question that seems obvious may not be the question that leads to effective action. Effective questions turn your mind in directions that lead to new insights and solutions. They highlight hidden assumptions and indicate directions to take to make progress. What should be the goals of education beyond good grades and a sheepskin? Ideally, the goal of education should be to develop critical thinking and communication skills and other such mind-strengthening abilities. Seeing the Flow of Ideas Iterate ideas. An illuminated lightbulb is the iconic metaphor for a bright, original idea. But one part of the metaphor is simply wrong—the brightness of a lightbulb occurs in a vacuum, whereas ideas never arise in a void. New ideas today are built on the ideas of yesterday and illuminate the way to the brilliant ideas of tomorrow. The only person who needs to move forward little by little is you. Engineer your own evolution. To generate new ideas through flow, first modify an existing idea within its own context and then apply that same idea in different settings. Then you can construct extensions, refinements, and variations. Think back. A look back makes earlier material easier. Once you understand a more advanced topic, look back to see what brought you to where you are. That process will improve your understanding both of the earlier work and of the more advanced work. One small step. One of the most heartening realities of human thought is that all the new ideas we have are, in fact, only tiny variations of what has been thought before. I begin with an idea and then it becomes something else. —Pablo Picasso Ask: What were they thinking? What beliefs, cultural habits, opinions, or actions that are completely accepted today will be viewed as ridiculous by our grandchildren? What are some possible candidates? Centuries ago, perfectly respectable people viewed slavery as a natural and moral practice. What practices that we accept as fine today will be condemned as offensive in the future? Engaging ChangeDefinition of insanity: Doing the same thing and expecting a different outcome Don’t mute voices that challenge your beliefs. Listen for whispers of doubt and turn those doubts into helpful and positive tests of assumptions, ideas, and theories. Doubts are strengths when you use them effectively. If the ability to change is part of who you are, then you are liberated from worry about weaknesses or defects, because you can adapt and improve whenever you like.

thinking skills, backed by convincing evidences that through continuous practice of those habits, we can all become a better thinker. Understand deeply: Don’t face complex issues head-on; first understand simple ideas deeply. Clear the clutter and expose what is really important. Be brutally honest about what you know and don’t know. Then see what’s missing, identify the gaps, and fill them in. Let go of bias, prejudice, and preconceived notions. There are degrees to understanding (it’s not just a yes-or-no proposition) and you can always heighten yours. Rock-solid understanding is the foundation for success. Make mistakes: Fail to succeed. Intentionally get it wrong to inevitably get it even more right. Mistakes are great teachers—they highlight unforeseen opportunities and holes in your understanding. They also show you which way to turn next, and they ignite your imagination.","content_length":953,"content_tokens":199,"embedding":[]},{"essay_title":"<img alt=\"The 5 Elements of Effective Thinking \" srcSet=\"/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.notion.so%2Fimage%2Fhttps%253A%252F%252Fimages-na.ssl-images-amazon.com%252Fimages%252FI%252F41WKP5UC67L._SL200_.jpg%3Ftable%3Dblock%26id%3D6b6fa78f-0fa0-473e-81c4-925d7c7d757d%26cache%3Dv2&amp;w=2048&amp;q=75 1x, /_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.notion.so%2Fimage%2Fhttps%253A%252F%252Fimages-na.ssl-images-amazon.com%252Fimages%252FI%252F41WKP5UC67L._SL200_.jpg%3Ftable%3Dblock%26id%3D6b6fa78f-0fa0-473e-81c4-925d7c7d757d%26cache%3Dv2&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x\" src=\"/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.notion.so%2Fimage%2Fhttps%253A%252F%252Fimages-na.ssl-images-amazon.com%252Fimages%252FI%252F41WKP5UC67L._SL200_.jpg%3Ftable%3Dblock%26id%3D6b6fa78f-0fa0-473e-81c4-925d7c7d757d%26cache%3Dv2&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75\" decoding=\"async\" data-nimg=\"intrinsic\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%\" class=\"notion-page-title-icon notion-page-icon\" loading=\"lazy\"/>The 5 Elements of Effective Thinking ","essay_url":"https://blog.liallen.me/the-5-elements-of-effective-thinking","essay_date":"February 3, 2023","essay_thanks":"","content":"Raise questions: Constantly create questions to clarify and extend your understanding. What’s the real question? Working on the wrong questions can waste a lifetime. Ideas are in the air—the right questions will bring them out and help you see connections that otherwise would have been invisible. Follow the flow of ideas: Look back to see where ideas came from and then look ahead to discover where those ideas may lead. A new idea is a beginning, not an end. Ideas are rare—milk them. Following the consequences of small ideas can result in big payoffs. Change: The unchanging element is change—by mastering the first four elements, you can change the way you think and learn. You can always improve, grow, and extract more out of your education, yourself, and the way you live your life. Change is the universal constant that allows you to get the most out of living and learning.

As you revisit fundamentals, you will find new insights. It may appear that returning to basics is a step backward and requires additional time and effort; however, by building on firm foundations you will soon see your true abilities soar higher and faster.

Focus entirely on solving a subproblem that you know you can successfully resolve. Clear the clutter. Uncover the essence. When faced with an issue that is complicated and multifaceted, attempt to isolate the essential ingredients. Step One: Identify and ignore all distracting features to isolate the essential core. Step Two: Analyze that central issue and apply those insights to the larger whole.

You should assume you’re introducing bias. The challenge remains to identify and let go of that bias or the assumptions you bring, and actively work to see and understand the subject anew. Being honest and accurate about what you actually know and don’t know forces you to identify and fill gaps in your understanding.

Self awareness is a rather complex topic that I foolishly ignored until I figured out that I literally have to unlearn everything as I’ve got so many things fundamentally wrong. MBTI is just one of those personality tests that happen to be quite popular among people. Listening to this podcast reminds me to think more about it. First and foremost, there’s no scientific backup for its validity or reliability. https://nesslabs. com/mbti gives good introduction about its history and raises solid questions about its potential flaws. But why is it still so popular? Consider there’re companies using it for making hiring decisions or individual meetups based upon it. Here are my guesses. For companies, there will always be needs for effective management. The human resource is dedicated for it. But managing people is hard and messy, and you can’t manage what you can’t measure. There’re not many rules or processes can be more effective than having employees cultivate and internalize beliefs about themselves that they are wired for certain type of “roles” because of their “archetypes” say so. For individuals, there is the need of belonging and feeling special since we’re all social animals. Behind the scene, there’s the deep seated insecurities among each individual. The test result amplifies this need well. The chance of falling under any one of the 16 personality types by average is 1/16, which is small enough to be considered as special and large enough not to be considered as exotic. Put aside the questioning of its validity. There is a popular mental model called \"The map is not the territory\". This isn’t to say there is no need for the map, or the map is totally useless. Quite the opposite, map is a rather useful tool and offers necessary generalizations for human interpretation of the territory. Since it’s human nature to simplify things, usually by some form of abstraction or analogy to things that we are already familiar with, so that our brain can reduce cognitive load and save energy for other activities. But it is the tendency of oversimplification that creates problems and stereotype bias is one of those problems. Especially in this Internet age we’re bombarded with all sorts of information, we tend to form premature judgement about someone we aren’t familiar with or never directly interacted with simply based on some overly generalized signals like occupation, race or gender etc. In addition to the problem of over generalization, a map is usually static while a territory isn’t. It evolves all the time, so does the human, only a matter of fast or slow. People with open mind and a growth mindset generally embrace different ideas and opportunities to challenge or update their existing beliefs and align their behaviors accordingly. Also, words are inherently subtle and heavily relying on context. Should we describe someone who is against social norms as a stubborn narcissist or an independent thinker? How about someone who is leaning towards risks, a reckless gambler or a fearless pioneer? How about someone who stays silent in front of strangers while can’t stop talking when hanging around with friends? There’re too many subtleties and contextual factors to be taken into account that aren’t easily achievable by tests with subjective answers. Even if it turns out to be more useful than it seems. As Weichen in his newsletter pointed out, getting to know yourself isn’t the end goal. Better self awareness naturally leads to the question of what should we do next? It’s easy to confuse a mean with an end. Nat Eliason once mentioned in his blog after achieving the income-automated “new rich” lifestyle popularized by Tim Ferriss best selling book “The Four Hour Work Week”, The mistake that I made, and that I imagine many people will make going down this path, is treating the income-automated lifestyle as an end in itself. I assumed it would deliver happiness and self-actualization once it arrived when I should have realized that the only reason to create this much freedom for yourself is as a means to pursue that self-actualization. Although the freedom Nat has achieved is quite appealing to many people (like me) already, the freedom itself doesn’t give any special meaning other than a sign that we won’t have to rent out our time to someone else anymore. We still need to figure out what to do with the freedom we earned back, which the Mexican Fisherman figured out long time ago. While knowing ourself better may help with decision making, and life is said to be all about decisions, it’s not always the case. Sometimes you make your decisions right without knowing everything you want to know. One of the good example I can think of is my personal favorite sports athlete Kobe Bryant. The NBA hall of fame basketball player who won five championship titles has determined basketball to be his calling since the age of three when he first touched the ball. And it has nothing to do with self awareness besides an inspiring dream from a little kid. And we know that professional sports are insanely competitive, according to estimation, the odds of an average high school player end up playing in NBA is only around 0.02 to 0.03 percent, let alone the probability of achieving what Kobe had later achieved. But Kobe made his dream come true and later successfully coined the mentality he developed over his professional career as the “mamba mentality”. While we may not argue that those mental muscles are useful weapons acquired by Kobe for achieving his ambitious goals, them alone won’t be able to paint the full picture of his success career either, there are just way too many people with the exact same mentality but aren’t 6′6″ as tall. It’s an example of you fake it until you make it. The obsessiveness and relentless commitment in making a dream come true is well captured in his Oscar winning short film “Dear Basketball” . Overall, similar to the complex world we live in, we human are also complicated. There’re infinite amount of unknowns that we have no clue about compare to our finite amount of knowns. While it may seem appealing to leverage tools to simplify things, sometimes it’s probably more practical to get out of bed and try stuffs out and see how it really goes.","length":7785,"tokens":1970,"chunks":[{"essay_title":"<img alt=\"Mbti\"

First and foremost, there’s no scientific backup for its validity or reliability. https://nesslabs. com/mbti gives good introduction about its history and raises solid questions about its potential flaws. But why is it still so popular? Consider there’re companies using it for making hiring decisions or individual meetups based upon it. Here are my guesses.

Since it’s human nature to simplify things, usually by some form of abstraction or analogy to things that we are already familiar with, so that our brain can reduce cognitive load and save energy for other activities. But it is the tendency of oversimplification that creates problems and stereotype bias is one of those problems. Especially in this Internet age we’re bombarded with all sorts of information, we tend to form premature judgement about someone we aren’t familiar with or never directly interacted with simply based on some overly generalized signals like occupation, race or gender etc. In addition to the problem of over generalization, a map is usually static while a territory isn’t.

There’re too many subtleties and contextual factors to be taken into account that aren’t easily achievable by tests with subjective answers. Even if it turns out to be more useful than it seems.

I assumed it would deliver happiness and self-actualization once it arrived when I should have realized that the only reason to create this much freedom for yourself is as a means to pursue that self-actualization. Although the freedom Nat has achieved is quite appealing to many people (like me) already, the freedom itself doesn’t give any special meaning other than a sign that we won’t have to rent out our time to someone else anymore. We still need to figure out what to do with the freedom we earned back, which the Mexican Fisherman figured out long time ago.","content_length":888,"content_tokens":195,"embedding":[]},{"essay_title":"<img alt=\"Mbti\" srcSet=\"/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.notion.so%2Fimage%2Fhttps%253A%252F%252Fstatic.scientificamerican.com%252Fsciam%252Fcache%252Ffile%252F6C86357C-13C6-4E43-852643E56345EA70_source.jpg%3Ftable%3Dblock%26id%3D6be2bd0a-45aa-4c4c-957f-b78f185493a4%26cache%3Dv2&amp;w=2048&amp;q=75 1x, /_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.notion.so%2Fimage%2Fhttps%253A%252F%252Fstatic.scientificamerican.com%252Fsciam%252Fcache%252Ffile%252F6C86357C-13C6-4E43-852643E56345EA70_source.jpg%3Ftable%3Dblock%26id%3D6be2bd0a-45aa-4c4c-957f-b78f185493a4%26cache%3Dv2&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x\" src=\"/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.notion.so%2Fimage%2Fhttps%253A%252F%252Fstatic.scientificamerican.com%252Fsciam%252Fcache%252Ffile%252F6C86357C-13C6-4E43-852643E56345EA70_source.jpg%3Ftable%3Dblock%26id%3D6be2bd0a-45aa-4c4c-957f-b78f185493a4%26cache%3Dv2&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75\" decoding=\"async\" data-nimg=\"intrinsic\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%\" class=\"notion-page-title-icon notion-page-icon\" loading=\"lazy\"/>Mbti","essay_url":"https://blog.liallen.me/mbti","essay_date":"September 20, 2022","essay_thanks":"","content":"While knowing ourself better may help with decision making, and life is said to be all about decisions, it’s not always the case.

The NBA hall of fame basketball player who won five championship titles has determined basketball to be his calling since the age of three when he first touched the ball. And it has nothing to do with self awareness besides an inspiring dream from a little kid. And we know that professional sports are insanely competitive, according to estimation, the odds of an average high school player end up playing in NBA is only around 0.02 to 0.03 percent, let alone the probability of achieving what Kobe had later achieved.

It’s an example of you fake it until you make it. The obsessiveness and relentless commitment in making a dream come true is well captured in his Oscar winning short film “Dear Basketball”  Overall, similar to the complex world we live in, we human are also complicated.

In life, a series of events or choices we’ve made in the past may give us more clue. To leverage stack trace for debugging, we need some degree of “logging”. This is usually done by searching our memories. The problem with counting on memories is that they aren’t as reliable as we would wish. This is where journaling comes into the scene.

The lowest caused by may often be the root cause, besides they hide deeply that you need a lot of patience to uncover them. Similarly, five whys is a good technique for root causing real world issues, including the struggles we’re dealing with. Patience is the key, don’t panic. After carefully analyzing the available evidences, we form our assumption. Making the right assumption is critical. For example, assuming it’s my fault is a good assumption while pointing fingers is not. When bugs popup, they’re much more likely caused by application code we wrote rather than framework or language constructs, thus it’s wiser to chop down the stack trace to lines associated with our own code. Jeff Atwood even calls this first rule of programming. When things didn’t work as expected, like when betrayal happens or relationship sinks, it’s always more rational to take the responsibility to reflect on ourselves rather than blaming others. This isn’t easy either, our ego will keep us blind from our mistakes. Self-defense is part of human nature, but true growth often comes from taking the harder road. ValidationDon’t forget to validate our assumptions. It’s usually done by taking actions and reviewing results. Again, journaling helps. It could be a repeated process since we might fail a couple times and our assumptions turned out to be totally wrong. If it happens, which is fair common unless you’re an expert in that domain and you developed unbiased intuition based on previous experiences, we’ll need to take a step back to form a new assumption and validate it accordingly again. This eventually builds up a feedback loop 🔁 from which we obtain better insight and judgments about the original problem through each iteration. Persistence is the key, knowledge compounds as long as we’re heading towards the right direction. Post-mortem Eventually the bug will be fixed, time to party right? Yes, but hold on for a second. Conducting a post-mortem reflection that summarizes lessons learnt, plus diligently asking ourselves where else in our life the same lesson can be applied, this will curate a long-term thinking that our future selves will be grateful for and save us from making the same mistake again.

Similarly, five whys is a good technique for root causing real world issues, including the struggles we’re dealing with. Patience is the key, don’t panic. After carefully analyzing the available evidences, we form our assumption. Making the right assumption is critical. For example, assuming it’s my fault is a good assumption while pointing fingers is not. When bugs popup, they’re much more likely caused by application code we wrote rather than framework or language constructs, thus it’s wiser to chop down the stack trace to lines associated with our own code. Jeff Atwood even calls this first rule of programming. When things didn’t work as expected, like when betrayal happens or relationship sinks, it’s always more rational to take the responsibility to reflect on ourselves rather than blaming others.","content_length":937,"content_tokens":197,"embedding":[]},{"essay_title":"🦆A life debugger","essay_url":"https://blog.liallen.me/a-life-debugger","essay_date":"June 8, 2022","essay_thanks":"","content":"This isn’t easy either, our ego will keep us blind from our mistakes. Self-defense is part of human nature, but true growth often comes from taking the harder road. ValidationDon’t forget to validate our assumptions. It’s usually done by taking actions and reviewing results. Again, journaling helps. It could be a repeated process since we might fail a couple times and our assumptions turned out to be totally wrong. If it happens, which is fair common unless you’re an expert in that domain and you developed unbiased intuition based on previous experiences, we’ll need to take a step back to form a new assumption and validate it accordingly again. This eventually builds up a feedback loop 🔁 from which we obtain better insight and judgments about the original problem through each iteration. Persistence is the key, knowledge compounds as long as we’re heading towards the right direction. Post-mortem Eventually the bug will be fixed, time to party right? Yes, but hold on for a second. Conducting a post-mortem reflection that summarizes lessons learnt, plus diligently asking ourselves where else in our life the same lesson can be applied, this will curate a long-term thinking that our future selves will be grateful for and save us from making the same mistake again.

Besides, it's also a good chance to have a fresh eye to spot some \"broken windows\" of the team that have long been ignored. Guess I don’t consider my enthusiasm as a bad thing, at least not until I became the designated mentor of interns three times in a row in my last job. Learn from the past experience, I decide to make some adjustments to my work routines. More specifically, I choose to engage less with instant messages or emails. Instead of replying \"now\", I default to replying \"later\". But how about all those annoying notifications that create the false sense of urgencies? Well, there's a setting on Mac called 'Do Not Disturb' mode for this. And my change turns out to be just fine. Recently my team get some new joiners again. I wasn't assigned as their onboarding buddy, so I have the chance to observe a bit more. As expected, there're new questions about onboarding or development machine setup in the team's Slack channel. But this time, instead of trying to be the first one to reply, I’ll usually notice the questions only after they have been posted and addressed since I’ve my notifications turned off. There're actually very few questions need my presence at all, consider I am not the most senior person in the team anyway. Although my disengagement doesn't seem to cause any obvious downside for me, it does come with some upsides. First, It ensures diligent research have been done. Better question leads to better answers while bad question just creates endless rabbit holes.

That being said, the quality of question does matter a lot, How To Ask Questions The Smart Way has detailed guidance on this. Sometimes we post our question too fast that we find the answer almost immediately after asking publicly. I personally made this mistake a couple times before and I always end up regretting about my rush. A lot of times it's simply caused by not reading the wiki or documentation carefully, or by not bothering to proofread what we're really asking about (but expect others to understand and answer it). Also, it matches the right supply with the demand. You aren’t alone in wanting to help others. If you happen to work in a team with toxic culture that no one is willing to help, looking for a better environment might be a more rational choice than attempting to fix it all by yourself. But quite often, there will be someone with appropriate domain knowledge happily stand up and teach. The result of this is that it avoids unnecessary context switching for you and you get more blocks of uninterrupted time for free. The cost of context switching can hardly be over emphasized for certain intellectual tasks (e. g. debugging subtle bugs without deterministic reproductions) that heavily tax the brain, Paul Graham also mentioned about this in his popular article Manager Schedule, Maker Schedule. Last but not least, It doesn’t really make you unhelpful. In fact, it merely eliminates the need to “show off” how helpful you are. If a well phrased question has been raised and doesn’t have an answer for an hour or two, you can always chime in and you have enough time to prepare for a well phrased answer as well. Good question tends to get good answer, it’s that simple. In the end, you'll enjoy the fact that it rarely hurts to be a bit more patient than the busy and noisy world wants you to be.","length":8792,"tokens":3396,"chunks":[{"essay_title":"<img alt=\"Be a

Sometimes we post our question too fast that we find the answer almost immediately after asking publicly. I personally made this mistake a couple times before and I always end up regretting about my rush. A lot of times it's simply caused by not reading the wiki or documentation carefully, or by not bothering to proofread what we're really asking about (but expect others to understand and answer it) Also, it matches the right supply with the demand. You aren’t alone in wanting to help others.

The cost of context switching can hardly be over emphasized for certain intellectual tasks (e. g. debugging subtle bugs without deterministic reproductions) that heavily tax the brain, Paul Graham also mentioned about this in his popular article Manager Schedule, Maker Schedule. Last but not least, It doesn’t really make you unhelpful. In fact, it merely eliminates the need to “show off” how helpful you are. If a well phrased question has been raised and doesn’t have an answer for an hour or two, you can always chime in and you have enough time to prepare for a well phrased answer as well.

However, it’s not always easy, my ego and blind spots usually prevent me from seeing things objectively, and I’ll lose a lot of good opportunities to learn as a result.

Not until recently, did I find a better way of dealing with similar situations, it’s by changing perspective. To elaborate it a bit more, I’ll pick a recent experience that I encountered at work. A couple weeks ago, there was a hack week event and one of my teammate came up with a prototype to an existing problem we’re facing at work, that’s we don’t have an universal typing system that allows developer to share code between front end and backend codebase written in different programming languages. It’s similar to open source tool trpc but is adapted to our in-house infrastructure. I was very excited to see improvements like this, so I directly jumped into reading the code to see what’s going on. However, after examining the solution, I found it works fine but not as good as I would expect. As a result, right below a few positive comments (mixed with political righteousness and sincere compliments) from different reviewers, I opted to sing a counter melody and left a few thoughts for improvements. Not surprisingly, my suggestions, although being received, yield no result. Similar experiences have happened before as well. On the one hand, I’m not criticizing irrationally since I appreciate that kind of efforts with sincere hope that things can get better. On the other hand, my honest feedback isn’t constructive enough to drive real changes to happen. Taking into account of the delicacy of human motivation, the way I handle nuances in communication becomes especially important. But it’s clear that what I’m proposing isn’t working well. Looking in retrospect, the more I examine my notion of “not good enough”, the more it resembles an excuse of inaction of myself. By inaction, I mean the resistance to commit real time and effort to workout a better solution or communicate effectively that delivers result. I’m only assuming there’s a better version on premise of theory without an actual “skin in the game”. If basing conclusions on theory, how could I tell if I’m not premature optimizing or not? Or maybe I’m unconsciously falling into the common trap of nitpicking others work. The reflection eventually leads to a paradigm shift within myself, that’s if I’m not able to come up with a better solution to any existing problems within a bounded timeframe, I’d happily embrace the existing solution as current best solution, which will serve as a stepping stone for future improvements. And the changing in perspective works great. Instead of looking at the “Is the glass half empty or half full?” as glass half empty, I’m grateful that it’s half full. It helps me to avoid the tendency to optimize for a local maxima (specific to the problem that I’m facing) while shifting focus to a higher level, taking the entire team’s merit into account. It’s rare for people in corporate settings to have the drive to improve things and to see things as what can be instead of what it is. It’s both encouraging and crucial to have the foundational work being laid out first so that more improvements and contributions can arise. It’s the practice of good enough software.

And I cannot be happier with the changes it brought to me, I almost lost 20 pounds physically which makes me healthier than ever.

Life is more random than it seems. - Derek Sivers, How to Live We live in a nonlinear world although we think very linearly. We overestimate our ability to forecast future but never stop from doing it due to the need of sense of security and feeling in control of things. We live our life forward and understand it backwards so that we can rationalize everything happened with cause-effects as if hindsight bias doesn’t exist. But what does it really look like in reality? Our tracking record tells that we’re inherently bad at foreseeing any rare events and understanding ourself and a complex world around us. Flights can be delayed due to unforeseen weather conditions, Internet can be unavailable due to power outages, doctor appointments can be cancelled and rescheduled without reasons. In software world, uptime is often used as a measure of reliability or stability of online services. To meet the unprecedented customer demand to engage with online activities, many software companies adopted the on-call practice aiming at 99.99% above uptime (i. e. less than an hour downtime per year). The Netflix engineering team even famously invented a tool called Chaos Monkeys that randomly disables their own production instances to make sure they can survive that common type of failure without any customer impact. Not to mention economic or financial bubbles that may burst all of a sudden and cause catastrophic snowball effects. Last week I went on a trip to Seattle to explore around together with an aim to search for next home as I’m planning to move out of California. Instead of following the conventional “wisdom” to outline a concrete travel plan, I kicked off the trip with a one-way flight from SFO to SEA airport and booked stays through Airbnb in a just in time manner, typically 1/2 days before the current stay ends. That’s I purposefully go with an unplanned schedule for the travel. It may sounds a bit wild at first, but probably not completely irrational if taking my intent to grip an authentic feeling of a new place within a short period of time into account. There’re a few things that I learned from the tripUber or Lyft drivers are great information sources. Due to their wide exposure to all kinds of passengers and ad-hoc conversations, they tend to form a more comprehensive view of local affairs including food, neighborhoods, culture etc. While talking to friends who live there is another shortcut to build a mental map of the place, the source of information could be narrowed by the social circles you’re in. And since lots of the drivers are immigrants from different countries, it’s a natural opportunity to learn more about cultural diversities. I’ve encountered drivers from all over the world, and many of them are from countries that I never heard about before, it’s fun to listen and learn a bit of new things each time. Airbnb would give you more surprises than hotels. Although those two price are already fairly close to each other nowadays, you'll get far more randonimity when staying with airbnb. I had a 2-night stay in an airbnb right next to the Aurora Ave which has a bad name for its prostitution scenes. I had no clue about Aurora Ave before the stay and it could be fair to stay that I won't book the place if I were well aware of its location by following certain popular travel guide. But in reality, the stay was great (average 5 stars by its guests) and Aurora Ave seemed to be just okay, at least not as bad as I had imagined. We can hardly be neutral about things without experiencing them ourselves, a lot of fears are simply caused by unground imaginations. Besides this one, there's another airbnb that comes with an in-house sauna that goes beyond my expectation for an affordable stay (around $100/night excluding tax and platform fees). We can get to make new friends when embracing a bit of randomness. A few weeks ago, a fellow colleague who is based in Seattle coming to SF for a company retreat, we haven’t met or worked with each other before besides I have listened to one of her engineering talk organized by the company before. We bumped into each other by accident in the SF office and I vaguely recognized her face. Instead of fear of talking to a stranger, I invited her for a walk around the office. In return, she did the same thing for me when I was visiting Seattle this time. It's completely random and can't be planned, but the experience is great. Unplanned trip doesn't cost much more than planned one. When revisiting the trip expenses, I calculated another version of a planned trip with round-trip flights and consecutive hotel stays, the unplanned trip only cost 20 to 25% more as the majority of the costs goes into accommodations which we can't really save much either way. So if you aren't a frequent traveler or budgeting expenditure isn't your primary goal for the trip, the extra costs are actually acceptable, to me at least. Imagine a planned trip. It might appeal to modern tourism and give you a sense of efficiency. There're an ocean of trip planning templates or travel guides, tourist attractions, restaurants and shopping checklists on the Internet. And they become popular simply because everyone is doing it this way in attempt to squeeze every little room of unpredictability with planned activities and accurate time frames so that everything fits perfectly within a round-trip flight schedule. It's as if it's the only right way of doing things given we're bombarded with commercial news and advertisements persuading us to do so. We fail to notice that so called personalization isn't that personal at all and so called efficiency isn't that effective as well. As a result, we're so attached to a false sense of control that any slight error or randomness may disrupt the entire trip. Jeff Bezos once said “Wandering is an essential counterbalance to efficiency. The outsized discoveries – the “non-linear” ones – are highly likely to require wandering”. Maybe it’s not a bad choice to break out the planning bubble every once in a while by fusing randomness into our lives in small doses and savoring the little surprises it brings.","length":6434,"tokens":1338,"chunks":[{"essay_title":"🎲Fuse a bit of randomness into life","essay_url":"https://blog.liallen.me/fuse-a-bit-of-randomness-into-life","essay_date":"October 23, 2022","essay_thanks":"","content":"🎲Fuse a bit of randomness into lifeTagsLifestyleDescriptionFuse randomness into life in small dosesPublishedPublished We think we see patterns and causes.

A philosophy of tech use in which you focus your online time on a small number of carefully selected and optimized activities that strongly support things you value and then happily miss out on everything elseDigital minimalism, according to Cal’s definition, is a typical working backwards example that modern technology like internet and smartphone should be adapted to reflect things we value deeply rather than serving as a constant source of distractions. Hence, digital declutter is a “radical” process proposed by Cal to redefine how we interact with those digital products and embrace a digital minimalism lifestyle at heart. WhyGenerally, under today’s attention economy, our attention and mind are constantly being “hijacked” by flooding news and social medias designed for business merits while ignoring human brain’s processing limit. As a result of information overload, mental issues like stress, anxiety and fear of missing out etc are becoming increasingly popular among the younger generations. Companies come up with different techniques like Personalization, Recommendations algorithms in response to the problem, only leading to new issues like information cocoons and filtering. Aside from it, not until recent years did I start to realize how much of my own time is “killed” by mindless activities like surfing the internet, watching news and seeking social proofs on social medias. Those gradually formed digital habits are so hard to recognize as we’re surrounded by people sharing the similar habits, e. g. sitting on a subway starring at the phone with short videos tailored to our specific interests playing for hours. Fortunately, books like Hooked and the Netflix documentary film The Social Dilemma became the wake-up call for me. As an engineer, I understand that to be able to solve meaningful problems, the ability to work deeply is crucial and deep work requires cultivating long attention spans. As James Clear the author of Atomic Habits points out, one way to break a bad habit is to replace it with a new one, so I decided to give the digital declutter process a try. How The book originally proposed a 30-days digital decluttering with our smartphone starting from a clean state(all apps uninstalled). As Cal points out, it’s intended to be “radical” as more lenient approaches don’t work well. But I personally found that 30 days plus uninstalling all apps may create too many barriers for me to even get started. So I tweaked it a bit to suit my situation better. More specifically, the steps areDo a one-week version of it, rather than 30 days, reflect and refine from thereRemove all the Apps (or Widget) from home screens, w/o uninstalling them so that I can keep notifications from work etcOnly add Apps back to home screen after a simple reason being recorded in NotionThere’re some prep work to be done so that our sudden change won’t affect others close to us and It should not affect important work related schedules. But overall, it’s graceful enough for a one-week experiment.

But there’s also the other side of spectrum I’d like to share, which is don’t confuse compromise with indifference. Compromise is hard, it’s about weighing trade-offs and then determine a course of action. Engineering is about trade-offs, same applies to life made up of all sorts of decisions. Therefore, there’s no question that compromise is inevitable when it comes to problem solving, the challenging part lies on where to “draw the line” for solutions to be considered as reasonably good. I have always been working in product teams, but with a keen interest to learn about how things work behind the scene. It serves me well to form a more solid understanding of how stuff gets connected to each other, but it also exposes me to much more “broken window” experiences. 🧪You might not need dev proxy was one of those deeply flawed experiences that I’ve faced, that is the login flow for product development was broken while all product teams work as if it is normal for years.

But there’s also the other side of spectrum I’d like to share, which is don’t confuse compromise with indifference. Compromise is hard, it’s about weighing trade-offs and then determine a course of action. Engineering is about trade-offs, same applies to life made up of all sorts of decisions. Therefore, there’s no question that compromise is inevitable when it comes to problem solving, the challenging part lies on where to “draw the line” for solutions to be considered as reasonably good.

Plus 1 iPhone taking the photo and 2 luggage bagsBackgroundLife never gets boring. Recently I decided to move out of California, which is my 5th relocation within the last 4 years, 4 out of 5 are cross country moves. One of the lessons I’ve learned since was that I don’t want to own shit. And it seems a natural move for me to take the 100 things challenge, which I initially got introduced by reading Pieter Level’s blog post. MotivationSince we all like telling stories to rationalize our behaviors, here are a few reasons I gave to myself Embrace a minimalistic lifestyle. It frees me from the burden of possessions so that I can literally pack and move at anytime. Meanwhile, to avoid being trapped into endless consumerism, I need to make conscious effort in differentiating what’s necessary, what’s nice to have and what’s not needed. Just for fun. Trying things out is fun especially when those challenges may stretch ourself in certain ways. Relocation and decluttering. Relocation is always a good chance for some decluttering and readjustments. Embrace constraints I’ve been trying to stick with some constraints listed below to avoid going viral with my possessionsOne in one out. I would buy something if I have something else to give away unless I really need that thing. E. g. I bought a new MacBook after I traded my old MacBook, I bought a new headset only after the old one was lost etc. Differentiate between necessity vs wants. Avoid buying unneeded or unwanted stuff (worse) by setting a cool down period, and only buying them when the same impulse pops into my head again and again. Go prime for things that I do need. I would buy things with best quality at a price that I can afford rather than wasting time hunting for the best deal. Embrace the Lindy Effect. Books or clothes that I kept for a while are more likely to continue being carried around with me. SuggestionsThis challenge might actually raise a lot of questions, such as whether you count this item or that, or whether you count a bunch of things as one item or not, or whether this item is considered “personal” or not. Decide it for yourself. This isn’t a competition, and it’s not a way to show off.

TagsParentsSelfDescriptionPublishedPublished It's always sad to hear about seemingly irreconcilable conflicts between parents and children, many of which last for years or even decades, and some may never get a chance to be resolved. Since each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way, it's almost impossible to generalize, but what I was told today is a story of a father who wants to design a life that he thinks is good for his daughter, while the daughter wants to own her own life. I'm sure most people won't be unfamiliar with this kind of story, but it's not always clear whether it's the parents working hard to death in order to exchange a better future for their kids, or if it's the kid fostering courage and independence to hold themselves accountable. As we know, different people like to tell different stories, and no one is crazy. I'd like to share my two cents on the nuances between parent-child relationships. In my experience, it is more often caused by the parent's tendency to be overly controlling rather than the child's rebelliousness. Children are rarely treated with respect and equality from the moment they are born. Who looks outside, dreams; who looks inside, awakes.― Carl JungMany parents feel like victims and only accept stories that validate their victimhood. It's easy to blame life when it throws us a curveball. Students complain about teachers treating them unfairly, employees grumble about their managers not appreciating their talents, and immigrants feel disheartened by discrimination and cultural clashes. Sound familiar? But what's the reality? Teachers can't always be biased, managers can't always be incompetent, and racists can't be everywhere. People often assume that everything happens to them and that there's no chance of things going the other way. With this mindset, they lack the patience and empathy to listen to the other side—their child's—and are filled with bitterness that no one understands how hard they work, even though they never consider if the obligation is necessary in the first place. They may turn to friends for help, but what they don't realize is that they're not looking for advice or a solution; they just want someone to confirm that it's their \"bad luck\" to have to spend so much time and money raising a rebellious child. They just want to vent. Acting miserably doesn't make you miserable. There must be a reason or logic behind such behaviors. It is a unique human ability to sympathize with the misfortunes of others, but this doesn't apply to someone who pretends to be blind and asks for empathy. As Richard Feynman, the famous physicist, said, \"The first principle is not to fool yourself - and you are the easiest person to fool.\" Ask yourself the simple question: \"Do I love my daughter because she is being herself or because she is the kind of person I want her to be?\" In the latter case, you are treating her no differently than a private property or a puppy. You may be offended by this question and think it too stupid to answer, substituting it with the cliche, \"Whatever parents are doing, we're always doing this for you\". But wait a second, do you really know what your daughter wants or likes? Have you ever spent time with her, sitting together and discussing her dreams and prospects? If not, how can you justify that your unconditional care and love isn't self-deception? The child may not know precisely what they want, but they know exactly what they don't want. It's much harder to identify what you like than what you don't. This applies to any aspect of life, such as subjects, relationships, and careers. The main issue isn't that people don't know anything; it's that they don't try anything at all. Society often dictates a linear life path, which is often determined by parental expectations. This ignores individual needs and desires. It's common for Eastern parents to expect the same things from their children: good grades, a stable job, and a safe marriage. This is as if they are the same person or made from the same mold. Unfortunately, they rarely question the status quo. Their reasoning is simply, \"everyone else is doing it\". They remain oblivious to the potential downsides of this life plan. Good grades without understanding are just memorization with no practical use, killing curiosity. A stable job without intellectual stimulation is just monotonous tasks to be automated by robots, stifling personal growth. A safe marriage without love and sacrifice from both sides is just an exchange of status or goods, leading to a high divorce rate and broken families. Based on Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, once basic survival and social needs are met, we naturally progress to higher pursuits. This is founded upon the awareness of self and what we genuinely like and dislike. It's their right to get to know themselves better by pursuing what they want, as long as they are willing to pay the price. How do you figure out what food, music, or sports you like? You're not born with a manual that clearly outlines your preferences. We're more like an empty hard drive, waiting to be filled with data from our environment. This data comes from our interactions with people around us. It forms a social circle, with family at the center and expanding to friends, community, and society.<img alt=\"notion image\" srcSet=\"/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fs3. us-west-2. amazonaws. com%2Fsecure. notion-static. com%2F7c1635e7-17ac-4201-bd3c-51d32bbc6b56%2FGroup_22. png%3FX-Amz-Algorithm%3DAWS4-HMAC-SHA256%26X-Amz-Content-Sha256%3DUNSIGNED-PAYLOAD%26X-Amz-Credential%3DAKIAT73L2G45EIPT3X45%252F20230325%252Fus-west-2%252Fs3%252Faws4_request%26X-Amz-Date%3D20230325T024440Z%26X-Amz-Expires%3D86400%26X-Amz-Signature%3Ddaa02734fc674c062a588958a6d30e44984a57c69a554454175333243b496df1%26X-Amz-SignedHeaders%3Dhost%26x-id%3DGetObject&amp;w=2048&amp;q=75 1x, /_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fs3. us-west-2. amazonaws. com%2Fsecure. notion-static. com%2F7c1635e7-17ac-4201-bd3c-51d32bbc6b56%2FGroup_22. png%3FX-Amz-Algorithm%3DAWS4-HMAC-SHA256%26X-Amz-Content-Sha256%3DUNSIGNED-PAYLOAD%26X-Amz-Credential%3DAKIAT73L2G45EIPT3X45%252F20230325%252Fus-west-2%252Fs3%252Faws4_request%26X-Amz-Date%3D20230325T024440Z%26X-Amz-Expires%3D86400%26X-Amz-Signature%3Ddaa02734fc674c062a588958a6d30e44984a57c69a554454175333243b496df1%26X-Amz-SignedHeaders%3Dhost%26x-id%3DGetObject&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x\" src=\"/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fs3. us-west-2. amazonaws. com%2Fsecure. notion-static. com%2F7c1635e7-17ac-4201-bd3c-51d32bbc6b56%2FGroup_22. png%3FX-Amz-Algorithm%3DAWS4-HMAC-SHA256%26X-Amz-Content-Sha256%3DUNSIGNED-PAYLOAD%26X-Amz-Credential%3DAKIAT73L2G45EIPT3X45%252F20230325%252Fus-west-2%252Fs3%252Faws4_request%26X-Amz-Date%3D20230325T024440Z%26X-Amz-Expires%3D86400%26X-Amz-Signature%3Ddaa02734fc674c062a588958a6d30e44984a57c69a554454175333243b496df1%26X-Amz-SignedHeaders%3Dhost%26x-id%3DGetObject&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75\" decoding=\"async\" data-nimg=\"intrinsic\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%;object-fit:cover\" loading=\"lazy\"/>The closer our relationships are, the more they influence and shape us. It's not just about genetic resemblance; our habits and beliefs are shaped by our parents, environment, and culture. To really know what we like, we need to try enough of what we don't like to find the right fit, rather than blindly accepting what others tell us. Failing to try enough is arguably a bigger failure than failing at things we're not good at. Good judgement is an invaluable skill that must be earned, not a gift to be given. Just like any kind of mastery requires deliberate practice, everyone starts from white-belt. It's only if we are humble and brave enough to overcome our awkwardness that we can progress to higher levels. Most people do not listen with the intent to understand; they listen with the intent to reply.― Stephen R. CoveyMaking a deliberate effort to understand your child is the first step. Although it may be difficult, there is no shortcut to mutual understanding. It requires both time and effort. It is not about projecting your own needs onto your child, nor is it about explaining yourself without taking others' interests into account. It is also not about mindlessly listening without seeking to understand and engage. It’s more about acting as a mentor instead of a dictator. You must learn to suspend your judgement, be willing to listen rather than speak, and only explain yourself if you have thoroughly understood the other side. With these attitudes in place, it will be much easier to have a high-quality conversation that deepens understanding of each other's perspectives. This can be used as the foundation for a strong bond based on trust and transparency, rather than a weak connection enforced by authority and compliance.","length":8984,"tokens":2433,"chunks":[{"essay_title":"👂Listen.

People often assume that everything happens to them and that there's no chance of things going the other way.","content_length":958,"content_tokens":186,"embedding":[]},{"essay_title":"👂Listen.

This applies to any aspect of life, such as subjects, relationships, and careers. The main issue isn't that people don't know anything; it's that they don't try anything at all. Society often dictates a linear life path, which is often determined by parental expectations. This ignores individual needs and desires. It's common for Eastern parents to expect the same things from their children: good grades, a stable job, and a safe marriage. This is as if they are the same person or made from the same mold. Unfortunately, they rarely question the status quo. Their reasoning is simply, \"everyone else is doing it\" They remain oblivious to the potential downsides of this life plan.

It always raises incessant debates that emphasize personal preferences while neglecting about what's the problem to solve. In general, there're 2 popular ways of doing this, i. e. grouping by file types (functionality) or grouping by features. Or if you embrace minimalism, a single index. php can be a reasonable choice as well. In fact, what's more important might be how you decide to name stuff.

There're 3 terms \"web\", \"api\" and \"handler\" each may have very different meaning under different context. In combining \"web\" with \"handler\", I got \"web handler\" (a. k. a \"controllers\") which is self explanatory. But how about \"web api\" (Web API??) and \"web webapi\"? After working with the codebase for a while, I eventually figure out that all stuffs within the web folder are web handlers for different purposes. i. e. web/handler is for page endpoint, web/api for api endpoint, web/webapi for api endpoint only accessed by browser or mobile. It's clear that this isn't an idiomatic way of naming things and professionals can do better than that. But how could it be named like this? Obviously there're some background stories. One of them is migration. Migrating from monolithic web applications to service-oriented architecture (data layer), as well as from multiple page app to single page app (presentation layer) usually happens side by side, this is what's causing above Page endpoints to be turned into a hybrid of Page and API endpoints. Then there's the pressure of getting things done. Everyone knows that business values velocity, and it's not a bad thing. Especially for tasks with little to none return of investment like migration, the rush to get it done and move into the next more interesting stuff is very tentative (I'm in the same group 😅). However, if we can zoom out a bit and evaluate the cost of time wasted to understand and maintain code full of arbitrary names, we might be willing to put a few extra minutes going through list like this and come up with more thoughtful names insteadAlso, people tend to assume others understand their assumptions. It’s a common cognitive bias called curse of knowledge. E. g. in naming the folder as \"web/webapi\", there is an assumption that the API is browser/mobile facing is a shared consensus, while I can't see why the same thing can't be applied to \"web/api\" either. Simple changes like below will help clarify this a lot├── handlers ├── page ├── api │ ├── protected You might ask \"what would be the idiomatic way of doing this then?\" Let's turn to the community for some inspiration, since it's usually smart not to reinvent the wheel unless for \"good\" reason.

Then there's the pressure of getting things done. Everyone knows that business values velocity, and it's not a bad thing. Especially for tasks with little to none return of investment like migration, the rush to get it done and move into the next more interesting stuff is very tentative (I'm in the same group 😅) However, if we can zoom out a bit and evaluate the cost of time wasted to understand and maintain code full of arbitrary names, we might be willing to put a few extra minutes going through list like this and come up with more thoughtful names insteadAlso, people tend to assume others understand their assumptions.

I dabbled around with different solutions for a while only to realize that react-query is more practical for most apps I am working with. Functional programmingReact reshapes modern web frontend with its declarative UI paradigm (rethinking best practice), and it embraces FP at heart. Stateless components, side effect segregation etc all good stuff. Then you may encounter immutability, and got amazed by the power of it since who doesn't like time traveling though? Followed by an unstoppable path of learning immutable. js, immer. js etc. At the end of day, I finally learned that JavaScript is a multi-paradigm language. React HooksHooks are great in terms of composibility but somehow deceitful as well. One thing is that a granular control over how state and effects can be composed for reusability does not mean the same granularity on rendering efficiency. The other thing is, for anyone who has been using it for a while, stale closure would not be unfamiliar for them. Suspense / React Server ComponentIt does took me a while to understand why spinner waterfall was an issue, especially for people who start their frontend journey in the age of ajax / spa was the “default” way of building modern web apps. Until then I realized how big paradigm shift it is those modern web apps powered by spa frameworks comparing to traditional websites powered by say Rails. This is exactly where those meta frameworks like next. js or remix come into play. They exist to bridge the gap or cliff driven by the need of bringing rich interactivity from native apps(i. e. mobile) to web, almost forgot that the web actually speaks html instead of JavaScript. There are a lot of other aspects to mention, but the learning is still in progress... After all, those are all just what we call trade-offs right?

It's physically taxing and it reminds me of the law of physics that I especially want to escape from during a run. But living in a hilly city (the 2nd hilliest in world) like San Francisco makes it really hard and sometimes impossible to avoid them. You'll know what I mean if you've ever visited the Chinatown area in SF, and thank God it doesn't snow here like the north east coast usually does during the winters.

Dense trees surrounded by groups of people hanging around with each other under the shades. This is what a destination looks like.

As dull as it looks, there's not much to be excited about, as well as not much to be afraid of. By simply letting the body and feel drives the move, it magically creates a steady rhythm for you. It's like that you’ve temporarily forgot about the pull of gravity and the earth becomes a flatten earth as if there’s no hill at all. Instead of hearing the sound of the surroundings, your deep breath and fast beating heart will draw your full attention and vividly remind you about the feeling of being alive and the necessity of embracing the moment. It's in fact when we’re constantly fantasizing about the future or rushing to an end that we get distracted and lost touch with our present body and mind. While keeping our heads down brings us back to the presence. We can only move forward one stride at a time and we’re fully in control of getting the current stride right. Of course, there're a lot of times when keeping the heads up during a run is important, just not when you’re dealing with a hill like this. Maybe I’ll find it the other day.","length":11826,"tokens":5304,"chunks":[{"essay_title":"⛰️Hills run made easy","essay_url":"https://blog.liallen.me/hills-run-made-easy","essay_date":"September 27, 2022","essay_thanks":"","content":"⛰️Hills run made easyTagsRunningDescriptionHeads down to live in presencePublishedPublished I used to hate running on hilly roads and I'll try to bypass it whenever possible.

It's like that you’ve temporarily forgot about the pull of gravity and the earth becomes a flatten earth as if there’s no hill at all. Instead of hearing the sound of the surroundings, your deep breath and fast beating heart will draw your full attention and vividly remind you about the feeling of being alive and the necessity of embracing the moment. It's in fact when we’re constantly fantasizing about the future or rushing to an end that we get distracted and lost touch with our present body and mind. While keeping our heads down brings us back to the presence. We can only move forward one stride at a time and we’re fully in control of getting the current stride right. Of course, there're a lot of times when keeping the heads up during a run is important, just not when you’re dealing with a hill like this.

Because the incompatibility issue I mentioned above, I’ve tried toset \"type\": \"module\" in package. jsonrename file extension to . mjsHowever, every change only leads to a new problem. To avoid going down the rabbit hole, I turned to other solutions. Solid Alternativestsxesbuild-kit • Updated Mar 4, 2023npx tsx file. tsAfter a bit digging around I came across tsx which nailed the problem. It’s a run time based on esbuild known for its build perf compare to other node-native build tools. It’s zero config, that’s you don’t even need a tsconfig. json to start using it. One of its biggest selling point to my use case isIt seamlessly adapts between CommonJS and ESM package types by detecting how modules are loaded (require() or import) to determine how to compile them. It even adds support for require()ing ESM modules from CommonJS so you don't have to worry about your dependencies as the ecosystem migrates to ESM. That’s we don’t have do deal with the fragmented module system issue mentioned above, which is arguably the most painful thing to resolve if you simply want to run some scripts. esbuild-registeregoist • Updated Mar 2, 2023node -r esbuild-register file. tsAnother tool worth mentioning is esbuild-register. Similar to tsx, it’s a thin wrapper around esbuild. Like babel-register that transpiles ES on the fly using babel, it transpiles TS on the fly using esbuild. Because of that, it shares the same gotcha as esbuild, but nevertheless a great option if your project has esbuild in place already. It’s not as out-of-box as tsx. But I’ve used it at work, and it easily scales to a Yarn Monorepo with 100+ Workspaces, which is fairly impressive and aligns well with the trend of front-end moving towards Rust / Go written build tools. The author of the tsx package has done a more comprehensive comparison between various TS runners. I haven’t used most of them and may not need them for my use case, but they serve as options out there. ts-runtime-comparisonprivatenumber • Updated Mar 4, 2023Summary To recap, if your use case is simple enough that can be generalized, go with ts-node thanks to its full fledged features due to wide usage, but if your use case is more advanced that involves dealing with a legacy codebase, tsx is a better option that addresses the need well and deserves more attention. Last but not least, what if the code is written in JS instead of TS, but with the same issue of transitioning from CJS to ESM? Consider giving esm and babel-node a shot.

Similar to tsx, it’s a thin wrapper around esbuild. Like babel-register that transpiles ES on the fly using babel, it transpiles TS on the fly using esbuild.

Last but not least, what if the code is written in JS instead of TS, but with the same issue of transitioning from CJS to ESM? Consider giving esm and babel-node a shot.

Simplify by encapsulation. How To Achieve Your 10-Year Plan In The Next 6 MonthsHow much time does something really take to accomplish? Before answering that question, a better question is: How much time do you actually have? Once you've answered that question, you'll then be able to ask: Where is all of your time going? Only then can you determine how long something really needs to take.<img alt=\"How To Achieve Your 10-Year Plan In The Next 6 Months\" srcSet=\"/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww. notion. so%2Fimage%2Fhttps%253A%252F%252Fmiro. medium. com%252F1*m-R_BkNf1Qjr1YbyOIJY2w. png%3Ftable%3Dblock%26id%3Df30e5bb7-dd97-4bf3-93a2-f110cf8d3490%26cache%3Dv2&amp;w=2048&amp;q=75 1x, /_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww. notion. so%2Fimage%2Fhttps%253A%252F%252Fmiro. medium. com%252F1*m-R_BkNf1Qjr1YbyOIJY2w. png%3Ftable%3Dblock%26id%3Df30e5bb7-dd97-4bf3-93a2-f110cf8d3490%26cache%3Dv2&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x\" src=\"/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww. notion. so%2Fimage%2Fhttps%253A%252F%252Fmiro. medium. com%252F1*m-R_BkNf1Qjr1YbyOIJY2w. png%3Ftable%3Dblock%26id%3Df30e5bb7-dd97-4bf3-93a2-f110cf8d3490%26cache%3Dv2&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75\" decoding=\"async\" data-nimg=\"intrinsic\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%\" loading=\"lazy\"/>https://medium. com/thrive-global/how-to-achieve-your-10-year-plan-in-the-next-6-months-f8c1cc54888e<img alt=\"How To Achieve Your 10-Year Plan In The Next 6 Months\" srcSet=\"/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww. notion. so%2Fimage%2Fhttps%253A%252F%252Fmiro. medium. com%252Fmax%252F1200%252F1*28nugG_z2Tg2K2_DMoJS6g. png%3Ftable%3Dblock%26id%3Df30e5bb7-dd97-4bf3-93a2-f110cf8d3490%26cache%3Dv2&amp;w=2048&amp;q=75 1x, /_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww. notion. so%2Fimage%2Fhttps%253A%252F%252Fmiro. medium. com%252Fmax%252F1200%252F1*28nugG_z2Tg2K2_DMoJS6g. png%3Ftable%3Dblock%26id%3Df30e5bb7-dd97-4bf3-93a2-f110cf8d3490%26cache%3Dv2&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x\" src=\"/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww. notion. so%2Fimage%2Fhttps%253A%252F%252Fmiro. medium. com%252Fmax%252F1200%252F1*28nugG_z2Tg2K2_DMoJS6g. png%3Ftable%3Dblock%26id%3Df30e5bb7-dd97-4bf3-93a2-f110cf8d3490%26cache%3Dv2&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75\" decoding=\"async\" data-nimg=\"intrinsic\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%;object-fit:cover\" loading=\"lazy\"/>“How can you achieve your 10 year plan in the next 6 months?” — Peter Thiel “Until we can manage time, we can manage nothing else.” — Peter Drucker “Nothing will fill your heart with a greater sense of regret than lying on your deathbed knowing that you did not live your life and do your dreams.” — Robin Sharma When you start acting in accordance with your intuition, you develop confidence.

The Tail End - Wait But WhyIn a post last year, we laid out the human lifespan visually. By years: By months: And by weeks: While working on that post, I also made a days chart, but it seemed a bit much, so I left it out. But fuck it. The days chart blows my mind as much as the weeks chart. https://waitbutwhy. com/2015/12/the-tail-end. html<img alt=\"The Tail End - Wait But Why\" srcSet=\"/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww. notion. so%2Fimage%2Fhttps%253A%252F%252Fwaitbutwhy. com%252Fwp-content%252Fuploads%252F2015%252F12%252FTail-End-F. png%3Ftable%3Dblock%26id%3D84a41cf0-da98-47ba-bced-fff7fa07a02a%26cache%3Dv2&amp;w=2048&amp;q=75 1x, /_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww. notion. so%2Fimage%2Fhttps%253A%252F%252Fwaitbutwhy. com%252Fwp-content%252Fuploads%252F2015%252F12%252FTail-End-F. png%3Ftable%3Dblock%26id%3D84a41cf0-da98-47ba-bced-fff7fa07a02a%26cache%3Dv2&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x\" src=\"/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww. notion. so%2Fimage%2Fhttps%253A%252F%252Fwaitbutwhy. com%252Fwp-content%252Fuploads%252F2015%252F12%252FTail-End-F. png%3Ftable%3Dblock%26id%3D84a41cf0-da98-47ba-bced-fff7fa07a02a%26cache%3Dv2&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75\" decoding=\"async\" data-nimg=\"intrinsic\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%;object-fit:cover\" loading=\"lazy\"/>Living in the same place as the people you love matters. I probably have 10X the time left with the people who live in my city as I do with the people who live somewhere else. Priorities matter. Your remaining face time with any person depends largely on where that person falls on your list of life priorities. Make sure this list is set by you—not by unconscious inertia. Quality time matters. If you’re in your last 10% of time with someone you love, keep that fact in the front of your mind when you’re with them and treat that time as what it actually is: precious. It turns out that when I graduated from high school, I had already used up 93% of my in-person parent time. I’m now enjoying the last 5% of that time. We’re in the tail end. Your Life in Weeks - Wait But WhyThis is a long human life in years: And here's a human life in months: But today, we're going to look at a human life in weeks: Each row of weeks makes up one year. That's how many weeks it takes to turn a newborn into a 90-year-old. https://waitbutwhy. com/2014/05/life-weeks. html<img alt=\"Your Life in Weeks - Wait But Why\"

To not only bounce back when things don’t go as planned, but to get stronger, smarter, and better at continuing as a result of running into this disorder. Goals and habits, as they are represented in mainstream culture, are very fragile things. some principles that come from Antifragile:Stick to simple rulesBuild in redundancy and layers (no single point of failure)… Seven modes (for seven heads) Here are seven modes that I think capture a good chunk of my own day to day states. Recovery Mode …Novelty Mode ……If you’re feeling stuck, switch modes. Try another head. Being a Hydra is all about the long term The 1st day of every month is your chance to re-start, revise, and recommit to the things that are most important to you. How To Be SuccessfulI've observed thousands of founders and thought a lot about what it takes to make a huge amount of money or to create something important.

One of the notable aspects of compound growth is that the furthest out years are the most important “I will fail many times, and I will be really right once” is the entrepreneurs’ way. You have to give yourself a lot of chances to get lucky. Look for small bets you can make where you lose 1x if you’re wrong but make 100x if it works. Then make a bigger bet in that direction. You can get to about the 90th percentile in your field by working either smart or hard, which is still a great accomplishment. But getting to the 99th percentile requires both.

Fear of failure, fear of rejection, fear of shame. These are the things that get in between us and our potential. Asking for help is a form of vulnerability. That's why people tend not to do it, they're afraid of displaying a lack of strength. But really, vulnerability is an incredible strength. Happiness conditional on external factors will always be unobtainable. The same thing goes for validation and safety. Money will not make you feel safe; nothing will. There is no safety in the face of your own mortality.

In essence, discipline produces action which leads to a more sustainable form of motivation. When we're procrastinating we're in a state of rest - motivation doesn't start the ball rolling. Only action can act as the \"external unbalanced force\" to push us into a state of motion. Once moving, a feedback loop develops and it becomes harder to stop because the desire to complete tasks provides the drive necessary to continue moving forward.

But there's a third ingredient that's not as well understood: an obsessive interest in a particular topic. To explain this point I need to burn my reputation with some group of people, and I'm going to choose bus ticket collectors.<img alt=\"The Bus Ticket Theory of Genius\" srcSet=\"/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww. notion. so%2Fimage%2Fhttp%253A%252F%252Fycombinator. com%252Farc%252Farc. png%3Ftable%3Dblock%26id%3Deaf77ce8-9c12-43cf-ad73-ea2a45cd2a0e%26cache%3Dv2&amp;w=2048&amp;q=75 1x, /_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww. notion. so%2Fimage%2Fhttp%253A%252F%252Fycombinator. com%252Farc%252Farc. png%3Ftable%3Dblock%26id%3Deaf77ce8-9c12-43cf-ad73-ea2a45cd2a0e%26cache%3Dv2&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x\" src=\"/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww. notion. so%2Fimage%2Fhttp%253A%252F%252Fycombinator. com%252Farc%252Farc. png%3Ftable%3Dblock%26id%3Deaf77ce8-9c12-43cf-ad73-ea2a45cd2a0e%26cache%3Dv2&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75\" decoding=\"async\" data-nimg=\"intrinsic\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%\" loading=\"lazy\"/>http://paulgraham. com/genius. htmlIf I had to put the recipe for genius into one sentence, that might be it: to have a disinterested obsession with something that matters. An obsessive interest in a topic is both a proxy for ability and a substitute for determination. The disinterestedness of this kind of obsession is its most important feature. Not just because it's a filter for earnestness, but because it helps you discover new ideas. Default Alive or Default Dead?October 2015[[[[ When I talk to a startup that's been operating for more than 8 or 9 months, the first thing I want to know is almost always the same.

Keep Your Identity SmallFebruary 2009[[ I finally realized today why politics and religion yield such uniquely useless discussions. As a rule, any mention of religion on an online forum degenerates into a religious argument.

The more labels you have for yourself, the dumber they make you. If people can't think clearly about anything that has become part of their identity, then all other things being equal, the best plan is to let as few things into your identity as possible. How to Be an Expert in a Changing WorldDecember 2014[[[[ If the world were static, we could have monotonically increasing confidence in our beliefs. The more (and more varied) experience a belief survived, the less likely it would be false. Most people implicitly believe something like this about their opinions.<img alt=\"How to Be an Expert in a Changing World\" srcSet=\"/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww. notion. so%2Fimage%2Fhttp%253A%252F%252Fycombinator. com%252Farc%252Farc. png%3Ftable%3Dblock%26id%3Dff042977-73e8-45f6-a2f9-033163030022%26cache%3Dv2&amp;w=2048&amp;q=75 1x, /_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww. notion. so%2Fimage%2Fhttp%253A%252F%252Fycombinator. com%252Farc%252Farc. png%3Ftable%3Dblock%26id%3Dff042977-73e8-45f6-a2f9-033163030022%26cache%3Dv2&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x\" src=\"/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww. notion. so%2Fimage%2Fhttp%253A%252F%252Fycombinator. com%252Farc%252Farc. png%3Ftable%3Dblock%26id%3Dff042977-73e8-45f6-a2f9-033163030022%26cache%3Dv2&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75\" decoding=\"async\" data-nimg=\"intrinsic\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%\" loading=\"lazy\"/>https://paulgraham. com/ecw. htmlWhen experts are wrong, it's often because they're experts on an earlier version of the world. Most really good startup ideas look like bad ideas at first, and many of those look bad specifically because some change in the world just switched them from bad to good. The first step is to have an explicit belief in change. It seems to me that beliefs about the future are so rarely correct that they usually aren't worth the extra rigidity they impose, and that the best strategy is simply to be aggressively open-minded. Another trick I've found to protect myself against obsolete beliefs is to focus initially on people rather than ideas. Surround yourself with the sort of people new ideas come from. If you want to notice quickly when your beliefs become obsolete, you can't do better than to be friends with the people whose discoveries will make them so.","length":48978,"tokens":22184,"chunks":[{"essay_title":"🔖2022 articles","essay_url":"https://blog.liallen.me/2022-articles","essay_date":"January 6, 2023","essay_thanks":"","content":"🔖2022 articlesTagsDescriptionPublishedPublished A few articles that inspire me the most in 2022.

Another trick I've found to protect myself against obsolete beliefs is to focus initially on people rather than ideas. Surround yourself with the sort of people new ideas come from.

Does good writer always write bad stuff, good speaker always give lame speeches, good company always ship junk product? Obviously not.

I have worked with some legacy systems and felt the pain of dealing with them, so I'd share some thoughts or strategies I've used before. Though there are some concerns worth more considerations than others, namely code synchronization (DRY principle) and backward compatibility (contract design) etc. Non-incrementalRewriteThat's migrating by rewriting the entire application. Due to restarting from scratch, it has less baggage in longer term but takes longer time span as well, but sometimes it's inevitable to do a full rewrite for tech stack overhauling or avoiding maintenance nightmares. Pros & ConsIt trades agility for simplicity (brute force)It creates a lot of duplicationsIt has high cost of communication to synchronize changes (versioning) due to the duplications IncrementalShared ModuleThat's migrating by extracting common logic into a shared module. It aims to contain changes (during migration) in a shared module, so that migrations along with feature development or bug fixes won't interfere with each other and thus can be carried out more incrementally. <img alt=\"notion image\" srcSet=\"/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fs3. us-west-2. amazonaws. com%2Fsecure. notion-static. com%2F8c7254b8-d49e-4852-8034-06415c646133%2FUntitled. png%3FX-Amz-Algorithm%3DAWS4-HMAC-SHA256%26X-Amz-Content-Sha256%3DUNSIGNED-PAYLOAD%26X-Amz-Credential%3DAKIAT73L2G45EIPT3X45%252F20230325%252Fus-west-2%252Fs3%252Faws4_request%26X-Amz-Date%3D20230325T024444Z%26X-Amz-Expires%3D86400%26X-Amz-Signature%3D65dc98506c5e34173107001ac54bf03f41bfb0f1cf57baa30f20de6f7c14020d%26X-Amz-SignedHeaders%3Dhost%26x-id%3DGetObject&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 1x, /_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fs3. us-west-2. amazonaws. com%2Fsecure. notion-static. com%2F8c7254b8-d49e-4852-8034-06415c646133%2FUntitled. png%3FX-Amz-Algorithm%3DAWS4-HMAC-SHA256%26X-Amz-Content-Sha256%3DUNSIGNED-PAYLOAD%26X-Amz-Credential%3DAKIAT73L2G45EIPT3X45%252F20230325%252Fus-west-2%252Fs3%252Faws4_request%26X-Amz-Date%3D20230325T024444Z%26X-Amz-Expires%3D86400%26X-Amz-Signature%3D65dc98506c5e34173107001ac54bf03f41bfb0f1cf57baa30f20de6f7c14020d%26X-Amz-SignedHeaders%3Dhost%26x-id%3DGetObject&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x\" src=\"/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fs3. us-west-2. amazonaws. com%2Fsecure. notion-static. com%2F8c7254b8-d49e-4852-8034-06415c646133%2FUntitled. png%3FX-Amz-Algorithm%3DAWS4-HMAC-SHA256%26X-Amz-Content-Sha256%3DUNSIGNED-PAYLOAD%26X-Amz-Credential%3DAKIAT73L2G45EIPT3X45%252F20230325%252Fus-west-2%252Fs3%252Faws4_request%26X-Amz-Date%3D20230325T024444Z%26X-Amz-Expires%3D86400%26X-Amz-Signature%3D65dc98506c5e34173107001ac54bf03f41bfb0f1cf57baa30f20de6f7c14020d%26X-Amz-SignedHeaders%3Dhost%26x-id%3DGetObject&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75\" decoding=\"async\" data-nimg=\"intrinsic\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%;object-fit:cover\" loading=\"lazy\"/>Pros & ConsIt trades simplicity (upfront design) for agilityIt minimizes duplication to reduce cost of communication I break them down into following phases.

I have worked with some legacy systems and felt the pain of dealing with them, so I'd share some thoughts or strategies I've used before. Though there are some concerns worth more considerations than others, namely code synchronization (DRY principle) and backward compatibility (contract design) etc. Non-incrementalRewriteThat's migrating by rewriting the entire application.

To some degree, I even hate those words. Don’t get me wrong in thinking that I don’t trust my parents, I’m merely disagree with the truthiness of that statement. I thought about pretending to agree with it, but I’m also doubtful about if sharing my genuine thoughts about it may hurt anything at all. First of all, it’s not really comparable. The world is changing rapidly although we might be bad at perceiving and appreciating it. Put it into perspective, a low-end smartphone accessible to most people today computes thousand times faster than those supercomputers NASA used to send astronauts to the moon in the 80s. Likewise, we can hardly predict a poor and closed country with a billion of population took a leap to open its border and suddenly rise as the top economic power of the world. Society forces everyone to change and adapt, we won't be able to step into the same river twice and we can’t do anything other than riding the wave most of time. Although technology significantly increases the production in society and raises our living standards, unlike what Keynes guessed in 1930 that the working week would be drastically cut to perhaps 15 hours a week, we actually ended up working longer and craving more. Teenager and younger generations are suffering from mental disorders more than ever thanks to the flourishing of social media and meticulously crafted addictive algorithms behind it, the rates of obesity and health problems caused by it reaches historical highs thanks to the mass production of ultra-processed food and the popularization of fast food culture. There seem to be little correlation between happiness and society wealth. Or by analogy, people who drives Mercedes today aren’t happier than emperor who rides carriage centuries ago. It’s not rational to appraise modernization and globalization by staying blind to all its tangible downsides or side effects. No matter what I do I’m standing on parents shoulder. Einstein famously said that he stands on the giants shoulder. We’re all students of history. Plato was a student of Socrates, Warren Buffet was apprenticed under Graham, Charlie Munger never shies from admitting Benjamin Franklin as his role model. In sports like NBA, while there’s incessant debate among media and fans about who is the G. O. A. T, it’s neglecting a simple fact that all players are students of the game and players before them. “I have stolen all of these moves from all these great players. I just try to do them proud, the guys who came before, because I learned so much from them. It’s all in the name of the game. It’s a lot bigger than me.”, as said by the hall of fame basketball player Kobe Bryant. Our connection and tiers with parents goes beyond biological resemblance. The way we think and behave are all deeply influenced by the family in which we grow up. And because the impact is so tangible that it becomes part of our subconsciousness that we barely notice. Nothing comes out of thin air, it's both dishonest and ignorant to fail to admit the foundational stepping-stones that our parents have laid for us. Instead of starting from scarcity like our parents did, we start from abundance. It’s even harder or more subtle to tell how much of our education or career choices is a result of our parents or our own efforts. It’s more important for me to pursue my own calling than to meet social expectations. It's a Chinese or Asian culture for parents to set high expectations on their kids to become successful in a society standard. And the society status quo is a powerful force for regulating human behavior and establishing sovereignty among states. It boils down to the simple fact that we’re all social animals with fear of rejection and longing for social approvals. As a result, one of the most common mistakes we all tend to make earlier in life and regret later is that we overvalue others opinions about us, “We all love ourselves more than other people, but care more about their opinion than our own” as said by the great Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius. But the reality is that no one really cares about how you look, what car you drive or how smart you are besides yourself. The biggest downside of over conforming to what the society values is that we lose touch with our inner selves. That sacred voices coming from deep in our heart or even soul. Self awareness is important, not only does it give me more objective view of my strengths and weaknesses, it also nudges me to embark on my own adventure. It reminds me to be authentic and to search for my own niches instead of settling with mediocrity that society wants from me. We’re all unique in our own ways, besides it takes diligent effort and courage to find it and turn it into specific skills that are beneficial for the society so that we can get paid for them. And those skills should not be bound to a specific role in a job, which is arguably a too narrow definition of human's potential. We're all multidisciplinary and good at multiple different things, while specialization is for insects. Be self accountable. You only live once, live it well. However, comparing to our past self is meaningful because it helps us become the best version of what we can be, which is the underlying principle of <img alt=\"Mamba mentality\" srcSet=\"/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww. notion. so%2Fimage%2Fhttps%253A%252F%252Fs3-us-west-2. amazonaws. com%252Fsecure. notion-static. com%252F0e43dc92-0366-4f91-92e7-44860f975e76%252FA868A6AD-9150-4D18-A454-11C26031A96E. jpeg%3Ftable%3Dblock%26id%3D99aa557e-6bf8-4bd4-9f17-89b114290a1c%26cache%3Dv2&amp;w=2048&amp;q=75 1x, /_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww. notion. so%2Fimage%2Fhttps%253A%252F%252Fs3-us-west-2. amazonaws. com%252Fsecure. notion-static. com%252F0e43dc92-0366-4f91-92e7-44860f975e76%252FA868A6AD-9150-4D18-A454-11C26031A96E. jpeg%3Ftable%3Dblock%26id%3D99aa557e-6bf8-4bd4-9f17-89b114290a1c%26cache%3Dv2&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x\" src=\"/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww. notion. so%2Fimage%2Fhttps%253A%252F%252Fs3-us-west-2. amazonaws. com%252Fsecure. notion-static. com%252F0e43dc92-0366-4f91-92e7-44860f975e76%252FA868A6AD-9150-4D18-A454-11C26031A96E. jpeg%3Ftable%3Dblock%26id%3D99aa557e-6bf8-4bd4-9f17-89b114290a1c%26cache%3Dv2&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75\" decoding=\"async\" data-nimg=\"intrinsic\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%\" class=\"notion-page-title-icon notion-page-icon\" loading=\"lazy\"/>Mamba mentality . Lifting weight that our past self couldn't lift, cultivating good habits that our past self hesitated to build, conquering fears that our past self used to be dominated by, those little stretches we do are good examples of what self growth is about, it’s the confidence gained from experiences, resilience gained from adversities, antifragility gained from stressors. Those little success stories compound over time to reshape our character and tells us who we really are. It’s understandable that it’s our parents wish for a better future. Hope is beautiful and probably the best of things in life. While it's important to be optimistic, you need down to earth discipline to make actual progress. Many people are so worried about looking good that they never do anything great. Many people are so worried about doing something great that they never do anything at all. https://sive. rs/below-averageAnd reality is our best measurement of truth. I used to be head in the cloud till I hit the wall and saw the harsh truth that I barely do anything other than daydreaming. I'm not getting any close to the kind of person that I’m aspiring to be and I’m not acting in accordance with value or beliefs that I wanted to follow. In fact, I avoid defining them in the first place. I am drown in the mud of mundane as I avoid setting concrete goals with an excuse of like being casual. No matter what stories we tell ourselves, it’s our actions that reveal our real values.","length":10007,"tokens":3034,"chunks":[{"essay_title":"<img alt=\"Not better than parents\"

In sports like NBA, while there’s incessant debate among media and fans about who is the G. O. A.

Our connection and tiers with parents goes beyond biological resemblance. The way we think and behave are all deeply influenced by the family in which we grow up. And because the impact is so tangible that it becomes part of our subconsciousness that we barely notice. Nothing comes out of thin air, it's both dishonest and ignorant to fail to admit the foundational stepping-stones that our parents have laid for us. Instead of starting from scarcity like our parents did, we start from abundance. It’s even harder or more subtle to tell how much of our education or career choices is a result of our parents or our own efforts. It’s more important for me to pursue my own calling than to meet social expectations.

It boils down to the simple fact that we’re all social animals with fear of rejection and longing for social approvals. As a result, one of the most common mistakes we all tend to make earlier in life and regret later is that we overvalue others opinions about us, “We all love ourselves more than other people, but care more about their opinion than our own” as said by the great Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius. But the reality is that no one really cares about how you look, what car you drive or how smart you are besides yourself.
